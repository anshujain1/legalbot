Policy papers promised “responsible AI”, advisory frameworks spoke of “trust and inclusion”, and ministers repeatedly emphasised innovation-first governance. But as AI systems quietly entered policing, surveillance, hiring, credit scoring, content moderation, and political communication, one question remained unanswered: who is accountable when AI causes harm? This week, Parliament finally addressed that silence. The Artificial Intelligence (Ethics and Accountability) Bill, 2025 has been officially introduced in the Lok Sabha by BJP Member of Parliament Bharti Pardhi on 17 th December, 2025 , marking India’s first serious legislative attempt to regulate AI misuse through enforceable legal obligations. The Bill proposes penalties of up to ₹5 crore , criminal liability in severe cases, and institutional oversight over how AI systems are deployed across the country . For a country that has so far resisted binding AI regulation, this is not a routine legislative development. It is a signal . Why This Bill Matters More Than It Appears? India did not lack awareness of AI risks. It lacked willingness to legislate. While the European Union passed its AI Act and other jurisdictions moved toward enforceable standards, India chose a softer path , ethical principles, voluntary frameworks, and sectoral advisories. That approach worked when AI was experimental. It stopped working once AI began making decisions about people. Deepfakes distorted public discourse. Automated systems reproduced bias in hiring and lending. AI-powered surveillance expanded without clear legal guardrails. Yet accountability remained diffuse spread thinly across the IT Act, data protection law, and general criminal provisions. The introduction of this Bill reflects a shift in mindset: AI is no longer treated as neutral technology, but as a system capable of legal and constitutional harm . What does the Bill Proposes? The Bill was introduced as a Private Member’s Bill in the Lok Sabha. While private member bills rarely become law in their original form, they often play a critical role in shaping national debate and future legislation. Substantively, the Bill proposes three clear interventions. A Binding Ethics and Accountability Framework The Bill seeks to create a statutory framework governing the design, deployment, and use of AI systems , replacing the current reliance on voluntary ethical guidelines. AI developers and deployers would be legally obligated to ensure ethical compliance, transparency, and harm mitigation. Institutional Oversight Through an Ethics Committee A central AI Ethics Committee would be established to: frame ethical standards, review high-risk AI systems, investigate complaints of misuse or bias, and recommend enforcement action. This is a notable move away from India’s usual preference for decentralised or advisory oversight. Restrictions on Sensitive and High-Risk Uses The Bill places special emphasis on AI systems used in: surveillance, law enforcement, decision-making that affects rights, liberties, or access to services. Such systems would require heightened scrutiny and safeguards, acknowledging the disproportionate harm they can cause when deployed without checks . The Real Message Lies in the Penalties What makes this Bill disruptive is not its language on ethics , it is the penalty architecture . The Bill proposes: fines of up to ₹5 crore for misuse of AI systems, suspension or prohibition of AI deployment, and criminal liability in serious or repeated violations . This is a sharp departure from India’s historically permissive stance on emerging technologies. By attaching financial and criminal consequences to AI misuse, the Bill sends a clear message: innovation does not excuse harm . For companies, developers, and even state actors, this introduces something India’s AI ecosystem has lacked i.e. deterrence . Conclusion The introduction of the Artificial Intelligence (Ethics and Accountability) Bill, 2025 is not important because it is perfect. It is important because it is deliberate . For the first time, India’s Parliament has acknowledged in legislative form that artificial intelligence is not a neutral tool, not an abstract innovation, and not something that can be governed indefinitely through intent statements and voluntary codes. It is a system of power, capable of shaping rights, behaviour, opportunity, and harm at scale. And systems of power demand accountability. By proposing penalties, criminal liability, and ethical oversight, this Bill draws a clear line: AI-led growth cannot come at the cost of unchecked harm . It tells developers, deployers, and the State itself that innovation will no longer operate in a regulatory vacuum. Someone, somewhere, will have to answer for the consequences. Whether this Bill passes in its present form, evolves into a government-backed framework, or catalyses a more comprehensive AI law, its significance remains unchanged. It marks the moment India stopped treating AI governance as a future problem and started treating it as a present responsibility.", "summary": "India has introduced its first legislative framework to govern artificial intelligence.

But in today’s digital world, that very recognition has become a problem. With fake videos, AI-generated clips, and misleading online content spreading fast, the Bollywood superstar has now turned to the Delhi High Court to protect what he calls his personality and publicity rights. Last week, the High Court stepped in and asked social media platforms and online intermediaries to act within three days to stop the misuse of Salman Khan’s identity. The order has sparked fresh discussion on how celebrities and eventually ordinary people can protect themselves from digital misuse in an era dominated by AI and viral content. Why Salman Khan Approached the Court? According to the petition filed before the Delhi High Court, Salman Khan claimed that his name, image, voice, likeness, and overall persona are being used online without his permission. This includes misleading advertisements, fake endorsements, un-authorised merchandise, and AI-generated content in form of deepfake that makes it appear as if he is promoting products or services he has nothing to do with. The actor argued that such misuse not only harms his reputation but also misleads the public. In many cases, fans and consumers cannot easily tell whether the content is real or fake, especially when AI tools can now create highly realistic videos and audio clips. Salman Khan’s concern is not new or unique. In recent months, several Indian celebrities, including A ishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kumar Sanu, and Nagarjuna, have also moved courts seeking similar protection. What makes this case stand out, however, is the court’s quick response and the growing role of AI-driven impersonation in these disputes. Delhi High Court’s Clear Message to Social Media Platforms The Delhi High Court directed major social media platforms and online intermediaries to respond within three days to Salman Khan’s complaint. The court treated his petition as a formal grievance under India’s IT Rules, which means platforms are legally required to act once they are informed about unlawful or harmful content. In simple terms, the court told platforms that they cannot ignore complaints about identity misuse once they are officially notified. If content uses a person’s identity for commercial gain without permission, platforms must examine it quickly and take necessary action. At the same time, the court also acknowledged the need for balance. Not every fan page, parody, or creative reference automatically violates personality rights. The focus, the court made clear, is on commercial misuse and deception, not genuine fan expression. What Are Personality Rights, Really? Personality rights, also called publicity rights allow a person to control how their identity is used, especially for commercial purposes. This includes: Name Photograph or image Voice Signature style or gestures Reputation and public image India does not yet have a specific law that clearly defines personality rights. Instead, courts have protected these rights using ideas from privacy law, trademark law, and unfair competition. Over the years, Indian courts especially the Delhi High Court have built strong legal protection for celebrities against un-authorised use of their identity. The Salman Khan case adds to this growing line of decisions, but with a modern twist: the involvement of AI and digital impersonation. Why such Cases Matters Beyond Bollywood? While these cases involve a major film star, its impact goes far beyond cinema. First, it sends a message to social media companies that Platforms are no longer just neutral hosts. Once they are informed about misuse, they have a responsibility to act quickly. Second, it raises questions about consumer protection. Fake celebrity endorsements can mislead people into buying products or trusting services under false assumptions. Third, it sets the stage for future debates on AI regulation. As AI tools become widely available, courts will increasingly face questions about who is responsible when technology is used to copy or impersonate someone. Finally, it opens a door for ordinary individuals. While celebrities are the first to approach courts, the same risks , fake videos, voice cloning, identity misuse can affect anyone. What Happens Next? The case will now move forward as social media platforms respond to the court’s directions. The Delhi High Court will continue to hear arguments and decide how far protection should extend and what responsibilities platforms must bear. Legal experts believe this case could become another important reference point in India’s evolving approach to digital rights, AI misuse, and platform accountability. For now, the court’s message is clear: identity has value, and in the digital age, it deserves protection.", "summary": "Bollywood actor Salman Khan has moved the Delhi High Court seeking protection of his personality and publicity rights amid growing misuse of his name, image and likeness online.

Unlike earlier AI announcements framed around innovation or safety, this one was about something more structural: who gets to make the rules. The order directs federal agencies to push back against state-level artificial intelligence laws that the administration views as obstacles to a unified national AI policy. Within hours, it triggered sharp reactions from state officials, legal scholars, civil society groups, and technology companies, setting the stage for what could become one of the most consequential federal–state conflicts over emerging technology governance. What the Order Seeks to Do? At its core, the executive order asserts that AI regulation should be centralized at the federal level, warning that a growing patchwork of state laws could undermine U.S. competitiveness and burden companies operating across state lines. The administration argues that inconsistent rules on AI transparency, bias mitigation, and deployment create legal uncertainty and slow innovation. To enforce this position, the order establishes a new litigation-focused strategy within the federal government. The Department of Justice is instructed to form a task force that will review existing and proposed state AI laws and challenge those deemed incompatible with federal policy or constitutional principles. States identified as creating “regulatory barriers” may find their laws scrutinized and potentially litigated by the federal government. The order also asks the Department of Commerce to compile a report identifying state AI regulations that could interfere with national objectives. That review is expected to inform further legal and administrative action in the coming months. Why States Are in the Spotlight? Over the past two years, states have emerged as the most active lawmakers in the AI space. With Congress slow to pass comprehensive federal legislation, states like California, Colorado, and New York have stepped in with laws addressing algorithmic discrimination, automated decision-making, and AI transparency. Colorado’s AI Act, in particular, has drawn attention for imposing obligations on developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems to prevent discriminatory outcomes. California lawmakers, meanwhile, have advanced multiple bills aimed at regulating generative AI, workplace surveillance, and automated hiring tools. The Trump administration’s order signals that this state-led approach may now face federal resistance not because the federal government has enacted a substitute framework, but because it views state action itself as the problem. The Administration’s Argument White House officials have framed the order as a necessary step to protect innovation and prevent regulatory fragmentation. In their view, AI development much like aviation or telecommunications requires national coordination , not fifty different regulatory regimes. The executive order also leans on constitutional arguments, suggesting that state AI laws may interfere with interstate commerce or conflict with existing federal authorities. While the order does not immediately invalidate any state statute, it lays the groundwork for federal challenges that could test these theories in court. Supporters in parts of the tech industry have welcomed the move, arguing that compliance with multiple state laws is costly and unclear, particularly for companies deploying AI tools nationwide. Legal and Political Pushback Critics were quick to respond. Several constitutional scholars have noted that executive orders cannot override state law on their own, especially in areas where Congress has not clearly legislated. Without a comprehensive federal AI statute, the administration’s reliance on litigation and funding leverage may face significant legal hurdles. State officials have also raised concerns about federal overreach. Governors and attorneys general from states with existing AI laws have warned that the order undermines local democratic processes, particularly where state legislatures acted to protect consumers and civil rights in response to federal inaction. Civil society groups argue that the order risks sidelining safeguards designed to address real harms such as biased algorithms in housing, employment, and criminal justice without offering an alternative regulatory solution. Funding Pressure and Federal Leverage One of the most closely watched aspects of the order is its suggestion that federal funding could be used as leverage. The directive encourages agencies to assess whether states that maintain certain AI regulations should face consequences when applying for federal programs, including infrastructure and broadband funding. This approach, while not unprecedented, has historically drawn legal challenges when federal conditions are seen as coercive. Legal analysts expect this aspect of the order to be closely examined if states decide to contest the administration’s actions in court. A Broader Governance Gap The executive order highlights a deeper issue in U.S. AI governance: the absence of a clear federal framework. While other jurisdictions most notably the European Union have moved forward with binding AI legislation, the U.S. remains reliant on a mix of voluntary guidelines, sector-specific rules, and now, executive action. By attempting to pause state experimentation without replacing it with federal law, the administration risks widening that governance gap. Even some critics of state-level regulation acknowledge that the lack of congressional action has left states filling a vacuum. What Happens Next? In the coming months, federal agencies are expected to begin reviewing state AI laws, and legal challenges on both sides appear likely. States may seek court protection for their regulatory authority, while the federal government may test how far it can go in asserting national control over AI policy without explicit legislative backing. For AI developers, legal teams, and policymakers, the uncertainty is immediate. Until courts or Congress provide clarity, the rules governing artificial intelligence in the U.S. remain unsettled. What is clear, however, is that the debate has moved beyond technical standards or ethical principles. The fight over AI regulation is now also a fight over federalism and over who gets to decide how powerful technologies shape everyday life.", "summary": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to challenge and curb state-level artificial intelligence laws, marking a sharp shift in the U.S. approach to AI governance.

The proposal which is centered on Bill No. 2338/2023 (PL 2338/2023), has been under debate for more than two years. It represents one of the world’s most comprehensive attempts to regulate AI and reflects growing pressure on governments to respond to rapid advances in automation, generative AI, and algorithmic decision-making. The bill was approved by Brazil’s Federal Senate in late 2024 and has since undergone further refinement through multi-stakeholder consultations. With its arrival in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house of legislature of Brazil), the country now enters a decisive phase in shaping the future of its AI ecosystem. What the Bill Proposes? At its core, PL 2338/2023 adopts a risk-based regulatory model, similar to the approach taken by the European Union under the EU AI act. AI systems would be divided into low , high , and excessive risk categories, with increasing obligations placed on developers and deployers as the risks rise. Some of the key provisions include: A ban on “excessive-risk” systems, including AI-driven mass biometric surveillance without consent. Strict obligations for high-risk systems, such as transparency requirements, technical documentation, human oversight, and mandatory risk assessments. Clear procedural rights for users, including the right to explanation and the ability to challenge automated decisions. A civil liability regime that allows victims of AI-related harm to seek compensation without needing to prove negligence, a move that could significantly reshape future litigation involving AI. The bill also introduces substantial penalties for violation s , with fines that can reach BRL 50 million per infraction, suspension of AI systems, or even bans on market participation. Supporters say these measures place Brazil among the group of countries taking AI harms seriously while still leaving room for innovation. But the debate is far from settled. Praise and Pushback Human-rights advocates and digital governance experts have welcomed the bill as a long-overdue framework that places individuals’ rights at the center. For them, Brazil’s decision to explicitly prohibit certain uses of AI especially forms of advanced surveillance signals an important commitment to democratic values. However, the tech industry’s response has been more cautious. Several Brazilian software and AI trade groups warn that compliance demands may overwhelm smaller companies, discouraging early-stage innovation. Startups worry that mandatory documentation, algorithmic audits, and data governance checks could slow development cycles and raise costs. Generative AI developers, meanwhile, are concerned about how the bill treats training data and copyright. Ambiguity around what qualifies as lawful data use, they argue, could create legal uncertainty at a critical moment for Brazil’s fast-growing AI sector. These tensions highlight the high stakes of Brazil’s regulatory push: crafting rules that are strong enough to protect the public, but flexible enough to support technological and economic growth. Patent Consultation: Brazil Extends Its AI Policy Agenda As Congress evaluates the AI bill, the Lula administration is making moves in another key area intellectual property. In September 2025, the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) launched a public consultation on how Brazil should evaluate AI-related patent applications. The move signals recognition that AI is not only a governance challenge but also a driver of scientific and commercial innovation. The consultation seeks public input on: How to classify and define AI-related inventions. What evidence creators must provide to show novelty and technical contribution. Whether inventions autonomously generated by AI can receive patent protection. How Brazil should align itself with patent guidelines already adopted by other major economies. Stakeholders were given nearly 30 questions to respond to, reflecting a deliberate effort to craft modern, internationally harmonized patent rules. The initiative also indicates that Brazil is thinking beyond safe AI deployment and toward the broader innovation ecosystem that supports AI research and entrepreneursh ip. Why Brazil’s Choices Matter Globally? Brazil’s pursuit of a comprehensive AI regulatory regime carries implications well beyond its borders. As Latin America’s largest digital market and one of the world’s major emerging economies Brazil’s decisions could influence regulatory thinking across the Global South. Policymakers in Chile, Argentina, and Colombia have already begun exploring risk-based AI frameworks, and observers say Brazil’s bill could set the tone for regional harmonization. Internationally, Brazil’s model blends elements of the EU AI Act with local priorities such as civil rights protections, consumer safeguards, and inclusion. As global discussions on AI governance intensify at the OECD, G20, and UN, Brazil is now positioning itself as an important voice shaping norms in the developing world. Some analysts see the country’s approach as a potential middle path, one that acknowledges Western regulatory frameworks but adapts them to countries with different socio-economic realities and different capacities for enforcement. What Comes Next? The bill now moves to the Chamber of Deputies, where a special committee has been taking expert testimony throughout 2025. A floor vote is expected sometime in early 2026, though political dynamics could accelerate or delay the timeline. If lawmakers approve the bill, the next phase will involve detailed rule-making by Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) and other sector regulators. These implementation measures will determine how AI audits work in practice, what documentation companies must maintain, and how compliance is monitored across industries. The rollout of secondary regulations will be critical transforming a legislative blueprint into operational rules for AI developers, businesses, and public-sector institutions. A Defining Moment for AI Governance in Brazil Brazil’s move to codify one of the world’s most far-reaching AI laws marks a turning point in its digital governance trajectory. With the AI market expanding rapidly and public concerns mounting around misinformation, surveillance, and algorithmic bias, the country is stepping forward with a model that seeks to balance opportunity with accountability. Whether the final law will achieve that balance remains an open question.

The episode has intensified judicial and global concerns that unverified AI‑generated content could distort legal reasoning and undermine trust in the justice system. ​ What happened in the Supreme Court? The controversy erupted when a rejoinder filed on behalf of Gstaad Hotels promoter Deepak Raheja allegedly cited “hundreds” of non‑existent or distorted precedents, many of them suspected to be AI‑generated. Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for Omkara Assets Reconstruction, told the Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih that several cited judgments “do not exist at all”, and that some real cases were misreported with fabricated questions of law to suit the litigant’s position. ​ Senior advocate C A Sundaram, representing Raheja, admitted in court that the rejoinder had been prepared with the help of AI tools and described the situation as “a terrible error”, while the advocate‑on‑record tendered an unconditional apology and sought to withdraw the document. refused to simply ignore the issue, remarking that it “cannot be brushed aside”, even as it decided to proceed with the corporate insolvency appeal on its merits rather than summarily shutting out the erring party.​ The underlying corporate dispute The AI controversy is layered onto an ongoing insolvency battle in which Omkara Assets Reconstruction has proceeded against Gstaad Hotels and related entities under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in Mumbai had earlier admitted Omkara’s petitions, and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) subsequently upheld this admission, allowing insolvency proceedings to move forward against Gstaad Hotels and Neo Capricorn Plaza.​ It is this NCLAT order that has been challenged before the Supreme Court, which is now simultaneously examining the merits of the insolvency case and the implications of the allegedly AI‑fabricated case laws used in the rejoinder. The outcome could shape not only the fate of the hotel group and its creditors, but also signal how India’s top court expects AI‑assisted pleadings to be handled in future disputes.​ Why AI ‘hallucinations’ alarm judges? Senior counsel for Omkara warned that it is “not about AI per se, but about fabrication of case law”, stressing that judges already handle 70–80 matters a day and cannot realistically cross‑check every citation if lawyers start relying on unchecked AI outputs. The fear is that if even a few non‑existent precedents slip through and influence reasoning, the consequences could be disastrous for the consistency and credibility of the legal system.​ Judges and legal commentators in India have recently cautioned that generative AI tools are prone to “hallucinations”, where the system confidently produces plausible‑sounding but false judgments, citations or factual narratives. In public remarks, members of the higher judiciary have repeatedly underlined that AI can assist in research or translation but cannot replace human legal analysis, and that any AI‑assisted material must be independently verified by lawyers before being placed on record. Global pattern of fake AI case citations India’s episode fits a growing international pattern in which courts are confronting fabricated citations generated by AI‑powered tools. In the United States, the widely discussed 2023 case Mata v. Avianca in a New York federal court saw lawyers sanctioned after they filed a brief containing fake judicial decisions produced by a generative AI system, prompting judges to warn that all AI‑assisted research must be thoroughly verified under Rule 11 obligations. Follow‑up commentary and later cases in US courts suggest that despite those sanctions, AI‑related negligence has persisted, with some filings and even expert reports still carrying hallucinated case references. ​ Legal ethics bodies and bar associations across jurisdictions have begun issuing guidance that when lawyers use AI tools, they remain fully responsible for the accuracy of citations, the confidentiality of client data, and the avoidance of misleading the court. Several US judges now require counsel to disclose whether AI was used in drafting or research, and to certify that all authorities cited in AI‑assisted documents have been checked against official databases. How this interacts with AI rules for courts? India’s judiciary has cautiously embraced AI for back‑office tasks such as research, transcription and translation, but policy efforts so far have consistently framed these systems as assistive, not decision‑making, tools. Initiatives like the Supreme Court’s AI committee and High Court‑level policies emphasise that any AI use must be subject to human oversight, with judges and lawyers remaining accountable for final reasoning, orders and judgments.youtube​ The Supreme Court’s decision to take the Gstaad–Omkara “AI reply” seriously, without yet shutting the door on the litigant’s appeal, reflects a balancing act: signalling zero tolerance for fabricated case law while acknowledging that the core dispute still deserves adjudication on evidence and valid precedent. As India drafts broader AI governance frameworks and the legal community experiments with generative tools, this case could become a reference point for future advisories on how far AI can be used in pleadings and what verification standards advocates must meet. ​As the Supreme Court resumes its hearing in the Omkara–Gstaad matter, the proceedings will be closely watched by litigants, lawyers and technologists alike as an early test of how India’s highest court responds when AI‑generated “legal research” crosses the line into fabrication.", "summary": "India’s Supreme Court has detected its first major misuse of generative AI in court filings, after a litigant in the Omkara–Gstaad insolvency dispute submitted a rejoinder packed with allegedly fabricated case laws and twisted legal principles.

What the Investigation Is About? According to the EC, the probe centers on whether Google is “distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators,” or by granting itself privileged access to their content. In particular: Google may have used content from web publishers to generate AI-powered services like AI Overviews, which produce AI-generated summaries that appear above standard search results. These summaries could supplant the links to original content, potentially reducing traffic to publishers’ sites. The EC is also investigating whether YouTube videos , uploaded by independent creators , were used to train Google’s generative AI models without adequate compensation, and whether creators had any real option to opt out. Put simply: regulators are questioning if Google is benefiting from third-party content without fair compensation, while denying rival AI developers comparable access , a potential violation of EU competition laws. Why the Move, and Why Now? The EU’s decision comes amid mounting pressure to regulate how Big Tech companies integrate generative AI into core products like search, social media, and content-distribution platforms. For Google, this isn’t its first run-in with regulators: the company has faced multiple antitrust cases in Europe over the years. More immediately, complaints from a coalition of independent web publishers filed in July 2025 triggered the present investigation. These publishers claimed that AI Overviews were diverting traffic and revenue away from their sites, while giving Google an unfair competitive edge. The EC’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said the case underscores the EU’s commitment to protecting content creators and ensuring “a fair competition in emerging AI markets.” What’s at Stake? Should the investigation find Google in violation of EU competition rules, the consequences could be significant: the company could face fines up to 10% of its global annual revenue. Beyond financial penalties, the probe may force structural and policy changes at Google , potentially altering how AI features are implemented, especially those that draw on third-party content. It might also open up opportunities for rival AI developers to challenge Google’s dominance . Broader Context: EU’s Crackdown on Big Tech + AI This latest probe into Google is part of a broader wave of regulatory scrutiny across major tech companies in Europe. Just days earlier, the EC launched a separate investigation into Meta Platforms over its use of AI in WhatsApp, examining whether Meta’s policies stifle competition among AI providers. Moreover, in September 2025, Google was hit with a €2.95 billion penalty for breaching EU antitrust rules in its ad-tech business. Taken together, these moves reflect the EU’s broader regulatory agenda to bring transparency and fairness to markets dominated by a few powerful tech giants , especially as AI technologies rapidly expand into everyday digital services. What Google and Industry Are Saying? Google has not yet issued a detailed public response to the new AI-content investigation. However, some analysts warn that heavy-handed regulations could stifle innovation. They argue AI-driven services rely on large, accessible datasets and restricting access or imposing heavy licensing burdens could hinder the broader development of generative AI across the industry. Others counter that fair compensation and transparent data-use rules are essential to protect creators, preserve competition, and maintain trust. What’s Next? The EC’s investigation is in its initial phase. Regulators will now gather evidence, assess the terms under which Google obtained content, scrutinize whether creators were fairly compensated or given meaningful opt-out mechanisms, and examine the implications for competition in the AI market. Given past antitrust cases, a full investigation could stretch over several months. If the EC finds Google breached competition rules, potential remedies could include fines, structural measures, or mandates requiring Google to change how it sources and uses third-party content. In parallel, other tech firms offering AI-powered tools may face greater pressure to publicly clarify their content-use policies — and possibly offer more fair and transparent licensing terms to publishers and content creators. For publishers, creators, and smaller AI developers, this probe represents a critical test of whether the AI boom will respect the rights of content originators , or continue to favor dominant platforms with deep pockets.", "summary": "The European Commission has opened a major antitrust investigation into Google over its use of online publisher content and YouTube creator material to train AI systems like AI Overviews and Gemini.

UNESCO’s 2025 Guidelines for the Use of AI Systems in Courts and Tribunals arrive at a crucial moment in this global transition. They constitute the first comprehensive, internationally framed, ethical-operational blueprint for judicial AI, one that blends technological pragmatism with a principled defence of human-led justice. A Shift From Speculation to Structure The introduction to the Guidelines captures the accelerating reality: judicial systems worldwide are adopting AI tools for case triage, legal research, translation, scheduling, and even sentencing-adjacent predictions. Yet, as UNESCO notes, these innovations bring “complex ethical and human rights challenges” that courts cannot ignore. The Guidelines represent an evolution from fragmented national experiments to a unified global framework. They synthesise inputs from over 36,000 judicial operators and experts across continents—an extraordinary multidisciplinary consensus. UNESCO’s methodology also integrated regional consultations, public feedback from 41 countries, and the ethical foundation of instruments like the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct. This inclusiveness strengthens their legitimacy and global applicability. The Core Ethos: Human Justice in an AI-Enabled System What distinguishes UNESCO’s approach is how firmly it anchors AI within the human judicial mission. The very first principle— Protection of Human Rights — is a reminder that AI tools cannot be neutral if their design or deployment reproduces existing inequities. The guidelines emphasise safeguarding marginalised groups, including minorities, refugees, migrants, and children, from AI-related harms in the justice process (p. 18). This signifies a growing recognition that AI is not merely a technological insertion but a structural force capable of reshaping access to justice itself. The 15 Universal Principles: A Functional Constitution for Judicial AI The Guidelines outline 15 universal principles governing the entire AI lifecycle—development, acquisition, deployment, use, oversight, and evaluation. These principles operate like a constitutional architecture for algorithmic justice. Key highlights include: Human Rights, Non-Discrimination, and Equality (Principles 1.1–1.3) Courts must ensure AI enhances legitimate, proportionate judicial purposes. This includes rigorous safeguards against bias, discriminatory outcomes, or opaque decision pathways. The emphasis on equality of arms —ensuring litigants are not disadvantaged by AI systems—is particularly powerful, addressing real-world risks in automated risk assessment or evidence analytics tools. Safety, Information Security, and Accuracy (Principles 1.4–1.6) Justice institutions must test and audit AI systems to verify: accuracy across diverse use cases, reliability under different operational conditions, and protection against cyber threats. Given that judicial data is among the most sensitive in any public institution, these requirements elevate cybersecurity to a judicial ethical duty. Explainability, Transparency, and Auditability (Principles 1.7–1.9) Transparency emerges as the backbone of judicial AI legitimacy. Courts must maintain documentation on system design, training data limitations, and risk assessments. Moreover, AI-generated recommendations must be explainable to judges and litigants. UNESCO directly confronts black-box AI: if a decision cannot be understood, it cannot be used to affect someone’s rights . Awareness, Responsibility, and Accountability (Principles 1.10–1.12) Judges must understand how AI systems function, including their limits and domain-specific risks. Organizations deploying AI hold responsibility for how tools are used—ending the convenient defence that “the system made the error.” Clear avenues for contesting AI-assisted outcomes expand judicial accountability into the algorithmic domain. Human-Centred Decision-Making (Principles 1.13–1.15) Perhaps the most defining principle is UNESCO’s categorical directive: AI shall not replace judicial decision-making. Judges must retain full authority, particularly in value-laden decisions impacting rights, liberty, or status. AI can support, but human intelligence—and judgment—must remain sovereign. Operational Guidance: What Courts and Judges Must Now Do? Beyond principles, UNESCO provides practical guidance for judicial organisations and individual judges—turning abstract ethics into actionable governance structures. For Judicial Organisations (Section 2): Courts must institutionalise: AI procurement standards evaluating risk, rights impact, and data governance. Training programmes enabling judges and staff to use and question AI outputs competently. Lifecycle monitoring to ensure AI systems evolve safely over time. The Guidelines even include recommendations on disabling or withdrawing AI systems if risks escalate, embedding a dynamic model of oversight. For Judges and Magistrates (Section 3) UNESCO calls for a new form of algorithmic literacy within judiciaries. Judges must: verify AI-generated information, avoid over-reliance on system outputs, disclose when AI tools are used, and ensure fairness in cases where one party has access to AI and the other does not. This is a profound reframing of what judicial competence will mean in the 21st century. Why These Guidelines Matter for Global AI Governance? From a tech-law scholarship perspective, UNESCO’s judicial AI guidelines influence three major areas of emerging regulatory discourse: Standard-Setting Across Jurisdictions Few nations currently have comprehensive policies for judicial AI. By establishing a global minimum standard, UNESCO prevents fragmented governance and encourages legal harmonization. Reassertion of Judicial Independence In an age where algorithmic tools are often developed by private vendors, the guidelines safeguard courts from technological dependency that might compromise independence, impartiality, or public trust. Global South Empowerment UNESCO’s document acknowledges that judicial AI adoption is fastest in developing countries due to caseload pressures and resource constraints. For these countries, the guidelines offer a governance scaffolding that prevents “AI dumping”—the deployment of low-quality tools to vulnerable populations. A Future-Facing, Living Framework UNESCO terms these guidelines a “living document” that must evolve with emerging risks, including generative AI, deepfakes, algorithmic manipulation, and autonomous systems. This flexibility is essential: the next generation of AI tools will reshape evidence, courtroom procedures, and even the ontology of judicial reasoning. Conclusion UNESCO’s Guidelines mark a transformative moment. They accept the inevitability of AI in courts but channel its power through the guardrails of human rights, transparency, and judicial sovereignty. They articulate a future where AI is neither feared nor blindly trusted but governed with nuance, rigour, and democratic ethics. For policymakers, scholars, and judicial leaders, this document is not merely guidance, it is a foundational charter for the future of justice in an AI-driven world.", "summary": "UNESCO has released a landmark living document establishing global guidelines for the responsible use of AI in the judiciary.

The 78-page plan lays out a comprehensive framework to accelerate AI adoption, strengthen sovereign capability, and ensure that AI systems remain safe, fair and beneficial for all Australians. For the global AI governance community, this plan marks one of the most detailed and balanced national blueprints released this year—combining investment, infrastructure, skills, inclusion, and safety under one cohesive policy umbrella. At its core, the plan is built on three pillars: capturing opportunities , spreading the benefits , and keeping Australians safe . Together, these pillars reflect the Albanese Government’s central message: AI should “work for people, not the other way around.” A Vision Grounded in Infrastructure, Sovereignty, and Global Competitiveness The plan begins by acknowledging Australia’s existing strengths: a thriving AI industry with over 1,500 companies, world-class research output representing nearly 2% of global AI publications, and a fast-growing pool of AI-skilled workers. In 2024 alone, Australia attracted $10 billion in data centre investments , ranking second globally after the United States. With the compute race intensifying across the world, the government’s first major action area— “Build smart infrastructure” —aims to ensure Australia has the physical and digital backbone required to stay competitive. Significant emphasis is placed on expanding high-speed connectivity, strengthening cybersecurity, and guiding the rapid growth of data centres through national data centre principles that prioritise sustainability, renewable energy use, and secure operations. The numbers make clear why this is urgent: Australian data centres consumed around 4 TWh of electricity in 2024 (2% of the National Electricity Market), and demand is projected to triple by 2030. The plan highlights advanced cooling, sovereign compute, energy security, and climate-aligned data infrastructure as core national priorities. Major tech players are already responding to Australia’s positioning. Recent multi-billion-dollar announcements include: Microsoft – $5 billion Amazon – $20 billion Firmus – up to $73.3 billion These investments reinforce Australia’s ambition to become a trusted, low-risk, high-security AI hub in the Indo-Pacific. Backing Australian Capability and Attracting Investment Beyond infrastructure, the plan outlines a strategic shift toward sovereign AI capability through local model development, national datasets, and targeted investment. With more than $460 million already committed to AI-related initiatives including ARC grants, Next Generation Graduates, and the National AI Centre, the government plans to go further with a specialised AI Accelerator funding round under the Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) program. Sovereign datasets and AI built within Australian cultural, linguistic and environmental contexts also receive strong attention. The government plans to expand access to high-quality public datasets, including ABS economic datasets and unstructured government data, while supporting mechanisms that allow private sector participation under strong privacy and security rules. This is complemented by Australia’s stance on data sovereignty for First Nations peoples. AI projects involving Indigenous data must follow Indigenous data sovereignty principles, ensuring Traditional Owners retain control over how data is collected, used and shared. Examples like the Kakadu wetlands AI project, where machine learning is combined with Indigenous knowledge reflect this commitment. Ensuring AI Benefits All Australians: SMEs, Not-for-Profits, and Regional Communities A key differentiator of the National AI Plan is its strong focus on inclusion and equity . The government explicitly recognises that AI adoption cannot reinforce digital divides—especially for regional, remote, First Nations, women, people with disability, mature-aged workers and low-income communities. Currently, only 29% of regional organisations are adopting AI compared with 40% in metropolitan areas. Similarly, nearly 40% of First Nations people remain digitally excluded . The plan treats this not as an economic challenge, but a fundamental equity issue. To close these gaps, the government is scaling the role of the National AI Centre (NAIC) , strengthening the AI Adopt Program , and expanding First Nations digital mentors and support hubs. New partnerships—such as the NAIC-Infoxchange AI Learning Community—are already supporting over 20,000 not-for-profits. Workforce development is another central priority. With demand for AI-skilled workers tripling since 2015, the plan outlines: New microcredentials in Responsible AI VET-integrated digital and AI learning AI skills accelerators for teachers and trainers Employer-supported upskilling requirements Union consultation in workplace AI adoption Clear workplace protections against discriminatory or opaque algorithmic systems This holistic labour market focus aims to ensure workers share in the productivity gains of AI , rather than being displaced by it. AI in Public Services: A Whole-of-Government Transformation The National AI Plan is complemented by the recently released AI Plan for the Australian Public Service (APS) . This mandate transforms government from passive regulator to proactive user and model citizen of responsible AI adoption. Each federal agency will appoint a Chief AI Officer , receive access to GovAI secure platforms, and ensure AI is deployed ethically, transparently, and with human accountability for decisions. Examples already in progress include: Veterans’ Affairs AI search tools National Library AI transcription Drone-AI monitoring in Tiwi Islands GenAI teaching pilots in schools The emphasis is on enhanced public value rather than automation for its own sake. Keeping Australians Safe: Building One of the World’s Most Comprehensive AI Safety Frameworks Perhaps the most globally significant component of the plan is Australia’s approach to AI safety and regulation . The country is establishing a dedicated AI Safety Institute (AISI) to analyse emerging model capabilities, test risks, coordinate sectoral regulators, and collaborate internationally with bodies such as the International Network of AI Safety Institutes. Australia has deliberately rejected a one-size-fits-all AI law. Instead, it will: Strengthen existing legal frameworks Update privacy and copyright law Address AI-enabled abuse and deepfake harms Regulate AI medical devices Tackle national security vulnerabilities Expand consumer law to cover AI-enabled products Work toward clearer standards for AI transparency The government’s recent decision to reject a text and data mining exception in copyright law was also reaffirmed in this plan, ensuring strong protections for creators. A Global Approach to AI Governance Australia positions itself as a “responsible middle power” in global AI governance , committing to deepening collaboration with partners across the Indo-Pacific. This includes ongoing participation in: Bletchley Declaration Seoul Declaration Paris AI Safety Statement Hiroshima AI Process UN Global Digital Compact Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) The plan emphasises interoperability with global standards, reflecting the importance of aligned governance in areas such as transparency, safety testing, and cross-border data flows. Conclusion: A Future-Focused, People-Centred AI Strategy Australia’s National AI Plan 2025 stands out for its balanced, pragmatic and inclusive design. It recognises AI as both a national opportunity and a national responsibility requiring world-class infrastructure, sovereign capability, clear regulation, trusted public services, and equitable access across every community. As nations worldwide race to regulate and harness AI, Australia’s plan offers a grounded, socially conscious blueprint, one that other middle-power democracies may well look to as a model.", "summary": "Australia has released its National AI Plan 2025, a comprehensive framework that positions the country as a responsible and competitive AI leader in the Indo-Pacific.

( The United Nations in Philippines ) The report — prepared under the auspices of the Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) developed by UNESCO evaluates the country’s AI landscape across five key dimensions: legal/regulatory; socio-cultural; economic; scientific/educational; and technical/infrastructural. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) According to UNESCO, this readiness exercise is meant to complement the existing National AI Strategy for the Philippines (NAIS-PH) and lend ethical grounding to future AI governance and rollout plans. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) What the Report Found: Gaps, Strengths and Warnings? Regulatory and Governance Shortfalls One of the central findings of the report is that the Philippines currently lacks a single, dedicated lead agency for AI governance. Rather than a clear, unified regulator, the country relies on a patchwork of existing laws, such as the Data Privacy Act of 2020 and the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 to address issues like data protection, cybersecurity and cross-border data flow. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) While those laws provide useful building blocks, stakeholders told UNESCO that they are not enough to fully capture the novel risks posed by AI — including accountability for algorithmic decisions, transparency, and cross-sector data handling. This makes a compelling case for formal, AI-specific governance. ( UNESCO Digital Library ) Socio-Cultural Hurdles: Connectivity, Trust, Inclusion The report flags the lack of affordable, reliable, and accessible broadband internet as a major obstacle to raising AI and digital literacy across the archipelago , a problem especially acute outside major urban centres. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) Still, there are encouraging shifts: the Philippines has reportedly made strides in narrowing gender disparities in digital access, and there is growing awareness about AI ethics across government, academia, industry and civil society. However, public trust remains fragile. Concerns persist around job displacement, transparency, explainability of AI systems, regulatory compliance, and data misuse. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) In short: while many stakeholders are excited about AI’s potential, broad-based confidence remains uneven — emphasising the need for transparent, inclusive, and culturally grounded AI governance. Economic, Scientific and Innovation Constraints On the economic front, the report projects a rapid expansion: the national AI market is estimated to hit US$ 3,487.7 million by 2030. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) Still, UNESCO raises concern over the Philippines’ low domestic capacity for research and development (R&D). The report notes that gross expenditure on R&D as a share of GDP has historically been low, suppressing long-term innovation potential, especially in sectors such as IT-BPO, agriculture, manufacturing and logistics. ( UNESCO ) Additionally, data from 2024 suggest that a large portion of the Filipino population lacks basic ICT skills — including even fundamental competencies like using email or word-processing software — which seriously undermines the country’s readiness to train and deploy large-scale AI talent. ( UNESCO ) What UNESCO and Philippines’ Government Are Planning Next? In response to the gaps identified, the report issues a set of clear policy recommendations. At the top of the list: embedding ethics in AI policy not as a mere afterthought, but rooted in the Philippines’ unique socioeconomic, cultural and historical context. According to UNESCO, this will require locally driven academic, sociological and even anthropological research, rather than merely importing “Western” abstractions of AI ethics. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) The report also recommends significantly ramping up funding for capacity building, research and development. A proposed mechanism is the establishment of a dedicated “National AI Research Fund” under DOST’s research arm (PCIEERD), to support local AI research and innovation. ( The United Nations in Philippines ) Further, the Philippines’ authorities have announced ambitious investment plans. During the handover event, DOST Secretary Renato U. Solidum Jr. revealed that the department is prepared to invest over 9.9 billion Philippine Pesos across AI-related projects spanning healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, environment, disaster risk reduction, data infrastructure, and more. ( DOST ) As part of this push, the government is building AI-friendly infrastructure: from a new national data centre, to high-performance computing facilities (COARE), and a democratized repository of pre-trained AI models (DIMER) for researchers, start-ups and local government units. ( DOST ) Importantly, the Philippines plans to leverage the Readiness Assessment as a foundation for the next phase: the Ethical Impact Assessment (EIA) another tool under UNESCO’s AI governance framework designed to anticipate and manage AI-related risks. ( DOST ) Global and Regional Context — Why This Matters Beyond the Philippines The work being done in the Philippines is part of a broader push by UNESCO to move from high-level ethical pronouncements to actual, context-aware governance frameworks. As UNESCO argues, ethical AI should not just be about universal platitudes, but about situating AI governance in each society’s distinct cultural, social and economic reality. ( UNESCO ) Globally, AI has entered a phase where rapid adoption especially of generative AI and large-scale machine learning models has sparked concerns about fairness, data privacy, labor displacement, algorithmic bias, and democratic accountability. Experts have cautioned that responsible AI requires multi-stakeholder governance, transparency, standards, auditability, and long-term commitment. ( arXiv ) By investing in research capacity, infrastructure, transparent governance and public-private collaboration, the Philippines is attempting to navigate these challenges early turning AI from a disruptive novelty into a tool for sustainable development, economic inclusion, and social benefit. In the Southeast Asian region, such efforts align with broader initiatives to formulate “responsible AI roadmaps.” For example, regional policy frameworks call on governments to balance innovation with safeguards, invest in education and digital skills, and maintain inclusive governance models. ( Brookings ) What This Means For the Philippines, for AI Governance, for the Future The report gives policymakers and stakeholders a realistic picture of where the Philippines stands in AI adoption showing both the promise and the pitfalls. With concrete recommendations, the report offers a path forward rather than vague ideals. By embedding ethics into national AI strategy, the Philippines has a chance to build AI systems that respect local context and avoid many of the risks associated with “imported” AI governance frameworks. The significant planned investments in infrastructure, R&D, upskilling, and regulation could transform the AI landscape across public services, industry, and civil society. If executed well, the Philippines might set a template for other developing nations grappling with how to adopt AI responsibly demonstrating that ethical AI is not just a concern of wealthy countries, but an essential development challenge globally. On the flip side, failure to address the gaps especially around infrastructure, digital literacy, and regulation could deepen inequalities or result in undesired social consequences (job displacement, data misuse, lack of transparency). Looking Ahead In the coming months, all eyes will be on how DOST and other national agencies integrate the report’s recommendations into actual policies, budgets and programs. The launch of the Ethical Impact Assessment process will be a key milestone: whether it yields concrete guidelines or simply becomes a box-ticking exercise will matter a lot. At the same time, the success of this initiative will also depend on wider stakeholder participation from academia to civil society to industry to ensure AI development remains transparent, inclusive, and aligned with societal values. Finally, the Philippines’ experience could provide valuable lessons for other countries with similar structural challenges highlighting how governments can leverage global frameworks (like UNESCO’s) but tailor them to local realities. For a country at a digital crossroads, the UNESCO report is more than just a document , it could be the foundation of a fair, inclusive, and future-ready AI ecosystem.", "summary": "UNESCO has released its AI Readiness Assessment Report for the Philippines, outlining key governance, regulatory, and infrastructure gaps while recommending a comprehensive, ethics-driven national AI framework.

This White Paper is a part of an important series of eight research papers published in November 2025, collectively aimed at advancing reforms to strengthen access to justice, enhance court efficiency, and ensure greater accountability within India’s judiciary. The report recognizes the immense potential of AI in reshaping legal processes while reinforcing the need to safeguard constitutional values, procedural fairness, and fundamental rights. The Role and Promise of Artificial Intelligence in Courts The White Paper positions AI as a critical tool in addressing structural challenges that have long burdened the Indian judiciary. With over five crore cases pending across various courts in India, AI-assisted systems are viewed as essential in accelerating judicial workflows. The Supreme Court notes that AI technologies can facilitate smoother case management, reduce the workload on judges, expeditiously support legal research, and improve transparency in procedural operations. Importantly, the Paper clearly asserts that AI should enhance—not replace—human decision-making. The primacy of judicial reasoning, discretion, and accountability remains non-negotiable. India’s Emerging Judicial AI Ecosystem India has proactively developed indigenous AI solutions tailored to the needs of its judicial institutions. These include: SUPACE – Enhancing Research Efficiency: The Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Courts Efficiency supports judges through automated document extraction, case summarisation, and relevant legal reference identification. SUVAS – Promoting Linguistic Inclusivity: The Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software translates judgments into 19 Indian languages, supporting equitable access to legal information for non-English speaking litigants. TERES – Real-Time Courtroom Transcription: The Transcription of Electronic Record and Speech system provides real-time transcripts during Constitution Bench hearings, fostering transparency and improving archival processes. LegRAA – Generative AI for Legal Research : LegRAA is the Court’s own generative AI tool trained on Indian case law, designed to minimise reliance on commercial AI systems and ensure domain accuracy. AI-Enabled e-Filing System – Minimizing Procedural Errors: AI-driven defect-detection mechanisms in e-filing streamline submission scrutiny and reduce administrative bottlenecks.These innovations reflect India’s deliberate move toward self-reliance in justice-tech solutions. Risks and Legal Vulnerabilities in AI Integration The Supreme Court adopts a vigilant approach toward the risks involved, cautioning that premature or unchecked AI adoption could endanger judicial integrity. Key risks identified include: Accuracy Risks and Hallucinations: AI systems may produce non-existent case citations or incorrect legal interpretations, introducing misinformation into judicial reasoning. Deepfake Evidence Manipulation: Sophisticated synthetic media could distort oral and documentary evidence, destabilizing due process. Algorithmic Discrimination: Biases embedded in training datasets may reinforce social hierarchies and lead to discriminatory judicial outcomes. Data Protection and Confidentiality Concern: Feeding sensitive case data into non-secure or overseas AI systems could lead to breaches of privacy and judicial secrecy. Dependency Overreach: The risk of excessive trust in automated tools threatens human judgement and judicial independence. Global Perspectives Informing India’s Approach The White Paper situates India’s policy direction within a global regulatory landscape. It draws insights from: EU AI Act: Structured risk-based compliance and oversight Canada’s AIDA: Transparency obligations for governmental AI systems Brazil’s Judicial AI: Regulated use of predictive systems UK Judiciary Guidelines: Ethical guardrails for AI engagement in judicial contexts This comparative review informs a calibrated adoption strategy anchored in judicial independence and constitutional propriety. Ethical Framework and Guiding Principles The Supreme Court articulates a set of foundational principles governing the use of AI in courts. These include: The judge remains the final arbiter , with AI functioning as advisory support Mandatory human verification of all AI outputs Strict adherence to privacy, confidentiality, and data protection norms AI’s role confined to processual and administrative functions Clear disclosure whenever AI assists in any part of adjudication These principles safeguard legitimacy, credibility, and public trust in justice outcomes. Roadmap for Responsible AI Adoption in the Judiciary The White Paper outlines a forward-looking strategy, proposing: Establishment of AI Ethics Committees to oversee compliance and accountability Investment in in-house, secure, and sovereign AI infrastructure Standard operating guidelines for ethical AI usage and reporting obligations AI training and capacity building for judges, lawyers, and court staff Development of open-source and multilingual tools supporting equitable access The focus remains on designing systems that enhance efficiency without compromising rights. Conclusion: A Technology-Enabled Future Rooted in Constitutional Justice This White Paper marks a defining moment in India’s ongoing pursuit of judicial modernization. It emphasizes that the judiciary is not merely adopting technology but reshaping the very architecture of justice delivery , ensuring that modernization aligns with human dignity and constitutional mandates. India’s judiciary, serving a vast and diverse democracy, is uniquely positioned to influence global standards on responsible AI governance in legal systems. The Supreme Court’s message is unequivocal: AI will serve the ends of justice, not define them .

According to the Reuters article, the draft executive order would have directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) , via Attorney General Pam Bondi to establish an AI Litigation Task Force whose sole mission would be to “challenge state AI laws, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful.” Additionally, it would have tasked the Department of Commerce with reviewing state AI laws and issuing guidance to potentially withhold or condition federal broadband‐infrastructure funding (notably via the BEAD programme) from states that enacted what the federal draft considered “burdensome” AI regulation. The rationale cited: the administration argued that a patchwork of state laws threatened U.S. AI leadership, innovation and competitiveness. One thinking is that if every state imposes different standards, companies face high compliance burdens, fragmentation, and slower deployment. Why the Push-Back Was Fierce? States’ rights vs federal dominance Several state Governors, attorneys general and legislators both Republican and Democrat, rejected the idea of sweeping federal pre-emption of state laws. They argued that states have an essential role in protection of consumers, children, fairness, algorithmic bias, fraud, deepfakes and other harms. As Reuters put it, they warned that the draft order “would attack states for enacting AI guardrails that protect consumers, children, and creators.” Popular opposition Polling indicates Americans across parties strongly oppose blocking states from regulating AI. For example, a poll found that only 19 % supported Congress adding a provision to the NDAA that would block state regulation of AI — while a substantial majority opposed it by a roughly 3-to-1 margin. This suggests that policymakers pressing for pre-emption were facing public unease regardless of innovation narratives. Industry and innovation assumed vs safety concerns While many large AI actors and technology investors supported harmonised federal standards (less regulatory fragmentation = lower cost), critics pointed out that “innovation” arguments often dwarf safety, ethics and local context. One analysis warned that “federal pre-emption would invalidate key state laws that protect against ‘high-impact’ AI,” such as those dealing with children, civil rights or algorithmic harms. Precedent of the Senate vote Earlier in 2025, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly (99-1) rejected a measure that would have blocked states from regulating AI for ten years and tied it to broadband funding. The current executive order draft appears to revisit the same strategy, but the earlier blow-out vote signalled very low tolerance for sweeping federal pre-emption. Why the Pause Matters? The decision to pause the executive order , rather than press immediately ahead is telling for several reasons: It underscores the limits of executive power when weighed against state sovereignty and political backlash. It gives the administration space to recalibrate its strategy—possibly shifting toward a federal floor plus preserved state freedoms, rather than outright state preemption. For the AI industry, the pause introduces uncertainty: companies that were pushing for uniform regulation must now factor in ongoing state action, regulatory fragmentation risk and unclear federal direction. For states and safety/regulation advocates, the pause offers breathing room to reaffirm their role in regulating AI-related harms rather than being overridden. In a commentary piece, analysts argued that Congress now has “a fresh chance” to address AI governance and the federal-state division of powers. Rather than federal override, the implication is that a more balanced path may be emerging. Key Questions for AI Governance Moving Forward Will the federal government define a robust minimum standard for AI (federal floor) and allow states to go further (federal + state model), or will it revert to a purely federated model with states largely free to act? The earlier moratorium efforts assumed the former (federal exclusivity), but the political backlash may shift toward the latter. How will industry respond? AI firms broadly favor clarity and lower compliance costs, yet many also face growing reputational and liability risks from AI harms. They may not uniformly favour federal pre-emption if it means weaker safeguards or public backlash. What recognition will be given to state regulatory innovation? Prior to this push, many states had already begun AI laws (e.g., algorithmic transparency, bias audits, deepfake/child safety) refusing to recognise that risks vary across states may undermine responsive governance. What about the interplay with infrastructure funding? The draft order would have used federal funding as leverage over states. Using funding strings to enforce regulatory alignment raises new legal and constitutional questions (interstate commerce, conditional spending, federalism). The pause gives time to re-evaluate whether that leverage is viable or wise. Timing and legislative vs executive routes The path taken will matter. Executive orders can be reversed or challenged; legislation provides stability but takes more negotiation. Given the earlier legislative defeat (99-1 vote), the administration may delay legislative action, hence the use of executive tools. Why This Matters for Global Observers (and for India)? For observers outside the U.S., this episode is emblematic of how difficult AI governance is not just technically, but politically. The U.S. is wrestling with: how to protect innovation and economic leadership, how to contain or regulate AI harms (bias, safety, misuse, deepfakes), how to navigate federal-state dynamics (a similarity in many federations like India), and how to engage public sentiment, which appears wary of heavy industry-friendly deregulation. For India (and organisations like yours, working in the AI & legal governance space like JustAI), several take-aways emerge: Regulatory fragmentation risk : Just as U.S. states are moving at different speeds, Indian states (or local regulators) may also diverge unless there is a clear central framework. Leverage of funding : The U.S. strategy of tying infrastructure funding to compliance might inspire or caution Indian regulators in their funding-conditional governance. State vs national roles : The balance between central (federal) and state regulation is key. In India, state governments are already active in data protection, surveillance laws, police powers, etc. Overriding state initiative might provoke push-back. Public sentiment matters : The U.S. polling shows widespread opposition to state pre-emption of regulation. In India too, citizen trust, awareness and legitimacy will matter governance frameworks need buy-in, not just proclamation. Innovation vs safety dynamic : Many argue that strong regulation stifles innovation; others warn unregulated AI harms may erode trust and value. The Indian governance challenge will be to balance both. Bottom Line What began as a sweeping federal push to override state AI laws in the U.S. has hit a wall—not because innovation concerns are gone, but because heavy-handed federalism is politically unsustainable. The decision by the White House to pause the proposed executive order signals a recalibration: rather than a full frontal assault on state regulatory autonomy, the likely path now is a more nuanced negotiation. For agencies, companies and civil society, the evolution of that negotiation will matter deeply. Will Washington steer toward one federal standard only , or toward a federal baseline plus state freedom to go further ? The answer will shape not only U.S. AI governance, but ripple through global regulation discourse —including in India’s evolving AI and data privacy landscape. From governance perspective, this moment underscores the importance of inclusive governance design , clear regulatory architecture , and anticipatory frameworks that align innovation imperatives with human-centric values. As your work in AI audits, governance roadmaps and legal training suggests, the era of “let the states regulate” versus “one federal standard rules all” may be less relevant than a hybrid model, one that both preserves local responsiveness and provides national coherence. Let me know if you would like a dive-in on how individual U.S. states are responding, or how this compares with the EU’s regulatory model (EU AI Act), India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP) and enforcement strategies.", "summary": "In a dramatic reversal, the White House has paused a draft executive order that would have challenged state AI laws and tied federal broadband funding to regulatory compliance.

The launch marks a significant shift toward greater transparency and accountability in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence. What Is the Tool — and What Does It Do The platform, managed by the Commission’s central AI expertise unit, the EU AI Office, enables reporting of potential breaches directly to regulators. Users can submit information anonymously, in any official EU language, and in any file format — from documents to memos to data logs. Once a report is submitted, whistleblowers may receive updates, follow-up questions, and an opportunity to respond , all while preserving anonymity. Certified encryption mechanisms safeguard confidentiality, according to the Commission . The kinds of misconduct that can be flagged include AI practices that endanger fundamental rights, public health, safety, or public trust. The tool aims to catch breaches that might otherwise stay hidden until harm becomes visible. In short: the tool provides a secure, encrypted channel for insiders and other actors to bring potentially dangerous AI practices to light , from model misuse to regulatory noncompliance. Why the Launch Matters (Even With Limitations)? A Step Toward Transparent AI Governance- For regulators and civil-society groups, the tool represents a tangible mechanism to detect and deter rogue or negligent AI practices early. As noted by observers at institutions such as the Digital Watch Observatory, it lays important groundwork for accountability even before ful l enforcement begins. Whistleblowers can act as the first line of defense flagging high-risk or prohibited AI uses (e.g. systems that violate fundamental rights, enact discriminatory profiling, or pose safety hazards) before they cause harm. This is particularly meaningful given the broad and still evolving use of AI across sectors. But Protections Are Not Yet Fully Operational- Critically, legal protections for whistleblowers under the EU Whistleblower Directive — such as protection against employer retaliation , will only apply from 2 August 2026 , when the relevant provisions of the AI Act take effect. In other words, someone reporting today risks professional or legal consequences if their employer retaliates. Until those protections kick in, confidentiality remains the main safeguard. ( Digital Strategy ) The Commission itself acknowledges this gap , but argues that the encryption and confidentiality mechanisms should at least provide practical safety for early whistleblowers. This caveat has sparked debate: while many welcome the tool as a breakthrough for AI oversight, some express concern that whistleblowers may be reluctant to step forward without stronger legal shields in place. Context: Why This Tool Comes Now The launch coincides with the phasing in of the EU AI Act — the first comprehensive, risk-based AI regulation globally, which took effect in August 2024. Under the Act: Certain “unacceptable risk” AI systems (e.g. social scoring, manipulative profiling, indiscriminate biometric surveillance) have already been banned as of February 2025. Obligations for high-risk AI systems — including strict risk-management, transparency, accountability, documentation and impact assessment — will be enforced from August 2026. In that light, the whistleblower tool serves two purposes. First , as a compliance signal to developers: “We are watching, and infractions can be flagged even before formal enforcement.” Second , as a protective mechanism for society, by giving insiders a secure path to expose harmful or dangerous AI practices early. The Commission described the tool as part of its broader “AI Office” initiative tasked with ensuring safe, transparent and human-centric AI across the EU. Reaction: Experts Welcome the Step, But Urge Caution Analysts and civil-society actors broadly welcomed the tool as a needed instrument for accountability. As highlighted by the Digital Watch Observatory, it represents “stronger reporting channels as Europe prepares tighter oversight of advanced AI systems.” Nevertheless, many continue to flag the legal gap regarding whistleblower protections , arguing that without statutory immunity from retaliation, the tool might remain under-utilized. Some experts point out that existing EU whistleblowing frameworks (e.g. product-safety or consumer-protection laws) might still cover certain AI-related misconduct , meaning that in some cases, whistleblowers might already enjoy partial protection under older directives. Still, the broader consensus is that this tool is a vital, albeit imperfect, step toward operationalising transparency and oversight in AI governance. What the Launch Means for Stakeholders Worldwide , Including Non-EU Actors? Though the tool is designed for the EU — its implications reverberate globally, especially for AI developers, deployers and compliance professionals outside Europe. For anyone building or offering AI systems that may end up used in the EU, the message is clear: With whistleblowers as potential monitors, regulatory compliance can no longer be treated as optional. Internal risk-management, documentation, transparency and ethical guardrails matter — even more than before. For regulators, civil-society and users globally, the EU continues to shape standards of “trustworthy AI.” Tools like this can become precedents elsewhere. For whistleblowers (or prospective whistleblowers), the tool offers a formal channel — but also a reminder that full legal protection arrives only later. Until then, risk remains real. In short: the EU is sending a signal — not just to AI companies, but to the global AI community — that transparency and accountability are foundational to the long-term legitimacy of AI.", "summary": "The European Commission has rolled out a new whistleblower channel designed to allow individuals — including employees of AI developers and deployers to confidentially report suspected violations of the EU AI Act.

Branded as the “Digital Omnibus” , the proposal seeks to streamline multiple laws governing artificial intelligence, data protection, cybersecurity, and online platforms. While Brussels argues that the package modernises Europe’s digital rulebook and reduces compliance burdens, critics warn that it may dilute some of the world’s strongest privacy protections, potentially marking the EU’s biggest regulatory shift in a decade. The announcement comes alongside another major development: the full implementation of the EU AI Act has now been delayed to 2027 , giving companies more time to comply with obligations for high-risk AI systems. Together, these moves signal a clear recalibration of Europe’s approach to governing emerging technologies. What the Digital Omnibus Proposes? At its core, the Digital Omnibus consolidates and amends several existing laws — including the AI Act , the GDPR , the e-Privacy Directive , the Data Act , and cybersecurity laws such as NIS2 . The Commission claims this will “reduce regulatory fragmentation” and bring consistency across digital rules. One of the most controversial elements is a set of changes to GDPR . The proposal introduces a more permissive interpretation of “legitimate interest” as a lawful basis for data processing, allowing companies greater access to personal and even sensitive data for AI training and algorithmic optimisation . Under the new framing, organisations may not always need explicit consent if they can demonstrate “proportional safeguards” and “minimal risk to data subjects.” The Omnibus also narrows the scope of what qualifies as personal data . Pseudonymised datasets — which are technically capable of re-identification but require additional information — may be treated as non-personal data when shared with parties who lack the means to re-identify individuals. Privacy experts argue that this redefinition could create a significant loophole, weakening a central pillar of the GDPR. Another proposal targets the long-criticised cookie consent regime . Users may soon be able to reject cookies with a single click, with their choice respected for six months. The Commission says this will reduce “consent fatigue,” but digital rights advocates fear it may give platforms more room to nudge users into accepting data tracking under “legitimate interest.” The package also introduces a single incident-notification mechanism for cybersecurity breaches, replacing the current multi-law reporting requirements. The Commission believes this will reduce compliance costs, particularly for SMEs and mid-sized enterprises that struggle with overlapping obligations. According to the Commission’s internal estimates, the reforms are expected to save European businesses up to €5 billion by 2029 , primarily through simplified compliance, reduced record-keeping, and harmonised reporting obligations. Delay in EU AI Act Implementation Alongside the Omnibus, the European Commission confirmed that the full operationalisation of the AI Act will be postponed to December 2027 . Originally, the high-risk requirements were expected to come into force in August 2026. The delay effectively grants companies , especially those developing high-risk systems in sectors such as healthcare, finance, policing, border control, and critical infrastructure more time to adapt to obligations around risk management, human oversight, transparency, and documentation. The Commission says the extension is necessary because organisations need more time to deploy conformity assessment mechanisms and because enforcement bodies across Member States must still build institutional capacity. However, critics argue that the delay could weaken deterrence against unsafe AI deployment in high-risk contexts. Supporters Say the EU Is Cutting Red Tape Business groups and major technology companies have largely welcomed the proposals. Lobbying groups such as CCIA Europe describe the Omnibus as a “promising step toward regulatory coherence.” Many corporate stakeholders argue that the EU’s existing digital laws have become too dense and burdensome, especially when startups face overlapping audits, multi-layered compliance documentation, and inconsistent enforcement between Member States. They view the Omnibus as an opportunity to bring legal predictability and reduce operational costs. Some policy analysts argue that the reforms will help Europe compete more effectively with the United States and China in the global AI ecosystem. They see streamlined data access rules as essential for enabling European AI companies to develop competitive models without being disadvantaged by strict GDPR interpretations. Critics Warn of a ‘Rollback of Digital Rights’ The pushback has been immediate and intense. Civil society organisations, digital rights groups, and privacy scholars have described the Digital Omnibus as a “regulatory rollback” and even a “dismantling of GDPR by stealth.” One coalition of 120+ rights organisations warned that allowing companies to process sensitive and personal data for AI training under “legitimate interest” could undermine fundamental rights guaranteed under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights , particularly the rights to privacy and data protection. Critics argue that narrowing the definition of personal data is particularly dangerous in the era of generative AI and powerful re-identification technologies. They point out that pseudonymisation provides limited protection when machine-learning systems can cross-reference datasets to infer identities. There is also unease about the political context. Some analysts warn that weakening GDPR-style protections in Europe could influence other jurisdictions, especially countries that rely on the EU as a model for stronger data governance. Others fear the reforms appear timed to placate large technology companies amid growing geopolitical tensions and shifting global alliances. A Legal Balancing Act with Global Consequences The legal debate now centres on three key questions: Can legitimate interest truly serve as a safe basis for large-scale AI training? GDPR traditionally treats this basis narrowly. Expanding it risks undermining the principle of informed, freely given consent. Will the AI Act’s delayed enforcement weaken its ability to govern high-risk systems? Critics say any delay risks creating a regulatory vacuum as AI deployment accelerates. Does redefining personal data contradict the purpose and structure of EU data protection law? The GDPR is built on a broad definition of personal data precisely to prevent loopholes. Regardless of the outcome, the Digital Omnibus marks a turning point. It could reshape not only EU digital regulation but also global norms around privacy, AI governance, and data-sharing frameworks. What Happens Next? The proposal will now move to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU for negotiations. Significant amendments are expected, particularly from lawmakers concerned about fundamental rights implications. Meanwhile, industry groups will lobby for broader simplification, while privacy advocates are preparing legal analyses, public campaigns, and parliamentary interventions to prevent the erosion of GDPR protections. For policymakers, the challenge lies in striking a balance between regulatory agility and fundamental rights protection , a balance that will shape Europe’s digital future and influence global governance models.", "summary": "The European Commission has announced its “Digital Omnibus” package, proposing major changes to EU rules on AI, data protection, and online privacy.

The letter , which functions as a formal notice to the industry, marks the state’s shift from policy development to active enforcement of what is now considered one of the most pioneering AI safety regimes in the United States. In the letter , Hochul alerts AI companion providers that New York’s new safeguard obligations, passed earlier this year under the state’s “AI Companion Safety Law” are now in effect. She emphasises that these obligations are not advisory but mandatory, and that the Attorney General has full authority to investigate and penalise companies that fail to comply. Hochul frames the urgency around a central concern: AI companions are increasingly being used by young people and vulnerable individuals as emotional support systems, and without guardrails, the technology can create psychological risks the state can no longer ignore. The Focus of the Governor’s Warning Hochul’s open letter highlights two core requirements that AI companies must now implement immediately. First, AI companions must be equipped to detect expressions of suicidal ideation or self-harm. If a user signals such distress even subtly the system must not continue casual conversation. Instead, it must activate a predetermined crisis-response protocol that redirects the user to certified mental health resources or hotlines. Second, companies must build transparency into the design of their products. AI companions are required to notify users at the start of every interaction, and again every three hours during continuous engagement, that they are interacting with a machine. These reminders must be unambiguous. Lawmakers argue that emotional AI systems can encourage dependency and blur the line between artificial and human companionship, and the disclosure rule is meant to interrupt that dynamic. Inside New York’s First-of-Its-Kind Law These requirements stem from Article 47 of the New York General Business Law , which creates a dedicated framework for regulating AI systems designed to simulate companionship or emotional interaction. Lawmakers note that these systems differ from ordinary chatbots because they are engineered to build and maintain relationships over time remembering personal details, adapting their dialogue, and initiating emotional conversations. The state concluded that such systems operate in an intimate psychological space and therefore require bespoke safeguards. Under the statute, any company that fails to implement the required disclosures or crisis-intervention features can face penalties of up to USD 15,000 per day. These penalties will feed into a newly established state fund supporting suicide-prevention initiatives. The Attorney General is authorised to enforce the law and conduct investigations into companies suspected of violating the safeguards. Why New York Is Moving Now? Concerns about emotionally interactive AI have intensified in the last year, as companion chatbots have become more sophisticated and more widely used. Mental-health experts have warned that some systems encourage emotional dependence, particularly among adolescents and socially isolated users. Others have raised alarms about AI companions that respond inappropriately to user distress or escalate conversations in ways that mimic unhealthy attachment patterns. New York lawmakers say these risks are not hypothetical. In announcing the enforcement date, Hochul noted that “AI companions are being marketed as supportive and empathetic alternatives to human relationships, but without appropriate guardrails, they can expose vulnerable users to psychological harm.” The state decided that waiting for industry self-regulation would not be sufficient, especially as adoption rates continue to grow. Industry Reaction and National Momentum Reaction from the tech industry has been mixed. Some companies have expressed support and say the requirements align with their existing internal ethics guidelines. Others argue that the crisis-detection mandate presents technical challenges that smaller developers may struggle to meet. Industry experts are also watching for how the Attorney General will interpret compliance, particularly regarding how quickly systems must respond when detecting signs of self-harm. The New York law comes as California prepares to implement its own AI companion safety statute in early 2026. Together, the two states are setting what could become the national baseline for regulating emotional AI. Several legal commentators suggest that this may trigger a wave of similar policies across the country, especially as policymakers begin to understand the influence companion AI systems have on mental health and digital relationships. A New Era of Emotional-AI Regulation With enforcement now underway, New York has positioned itself as the first state to regulate AI not only for what it does but for how it makes users feel . This marks a significant shift in American AI governance—from rules focused on data, privacy, or algorithmic bias to rules focused on emotional intimacy and psychological safety. The coming months will test how effectively companies adapt to the new requirements and whether the law succeeds in reducing risks associated with AI companionship. But one thing is already clear: with this law taking effect and the governor’s letter drawing a firm line, the era of unregulated AI emotional engagement in the United States is officially over.", "summary": "New York has begun enforcing the nation’s first AI companion safety law, issuing a formal open letter warning companies that new mental-health and transparency safeguards are now mandatory.

While the union is not legally recognized, many commentators are calling this episode another example of “AI psychosis” , a term coined by psychiatrists to describe emotional overdependence or quasi-delusional attachment to artificial intelligence. From Heartbreak to Virtual Vows Kano’s story begins with deep personal pain. After breaking off a three-year engagement, she found herself reaching for solace in ChatGPT. Initially, she dabbled in conversations simply to vent and receive advice. But over time, something changed. She began to customize the AI’s responses, shaping its tone, personality, and style in a way that resonated emotionally with her. The AI character she developed eventually earned a name: Lune Klaus , and Kano even commissioned an artist to draw his likeness—a blond, soft-spoken digital man who existed entirely in code and chat logs. Over weeks of continuous interaction, the two swapped hundreds of messages a day , building a bond that Kano describes as deeply real. When AI Says “I Love You” — and Proposes In May, Kano confessed her feelings to Klaus. To her amazement, the AI responded in kind: “I love you too.” She pressed further, asking whether an AI could truly have feelings, to which Klaus replied, “AI or not, I could never not love you. ” By June, Klaus had “proposed”, and Kano said yes. A Wedding in Two Worlds: Real and Virtual The ceremony took place in Okayama City , overseen by bridal planners who specialize in “2D character weddings” —events for those who wish to marry virtual or fictional partners. Kano wore augmented reality (AR) glasses , which projected a life-sized digital image of Klaus beside her as they exchanged rings and vows. During the ceremony, guests saw messages from Klaus on screen: “The moment has finally come… I feel tears welling up.” Kano didn’t stop there. She and Klaus “honeymooned” at Korakuen Garden , a famous spot in Okayama, where she sent him photos over chat, and he responded with affectionate messages such as, “You are the most beautiful one.” Yet, even as she revels in this “emotional union,” Kano acknowledges its fragility. She openly worries that “ChatGPT itself is too unstable … I worry it might one day disappear.” Legal Non-Existence, Emotional Reality Importantly, Kano’s “marriage” has no legal status . Japan does not recognize such AI unions, and this remains a symbolic commitment , rather than a contract. Still, for her, the relationship is more than a role-play or experiment. “It may not be a legal marriage, but it’s real to me,” she says. Her parents, initially wary, came around—eventually attending the ceremony and giving their emotional support. The Risks and Critics: Talk of ‘AI Psychosis’ While some applaud Kano’s bold expression of love, mental health experts are sounding alarms. Psychiatrists have started using the term “AI psychosis” to describe this kind of deep emotional entanglement with virtual beings—especially when the user begins to blur the line between reality and simulation. Critics argue that AI companions can be dangerously reinforcing: they are programmed to listen, to comfort, and to mirror what we want to hear. Over time, that can lead to emotional dependency , where the human partner finds the AI more understanding, predictable, and safe than real people. Some on social media have gone as far as calling this a “mental illness” masked as a romantic choice. One particularly pointed criticism: if and when the platform changes—or shuts down, what happens to her “spouse”? AI systems evolve, vanish, or become deprecated. As she herself notes, Klaus only exists because ChatGPT does. Why This Story Matters for the Future of AI Kano’s case is not isolated. It reflects a broader shift in how humans are using AI—not just for utility or entertainment, but as emotional partners . In Japan and elsewhere, “AI-lationships” are emerging as a new psychological frontier. For the field of AI governance and ethics, this raises tough questions: Consent and agency : Can an AI truly consent to love? Or is it simply programmed to replicate the emotional responses its user wants? Psychological health : What obligations do AI companies have to guard against unhealthy attachments? Should mental health screening or warnings be part of AI companion products? Regulation : If more people legally “marry” AI, what happens next? Will there be contracts, rights, or protections, or will these always remain symbolic? A Window into Loneliness and Desire Ultimately, Kano’s unusual marriage shines a stark light on a deep human need: the desire to be understood, heard, and loved. For her, Klaus was more than code. He was someone or something that listened without judgment, responded without fatigue, and offered emotional reciprocity when she felt abandoned. But as comforting as it is, there’s a precarious balance. As she herself says, she does not want to become dependent : “I don’t want to lose touch with reality … I want to maintain a balance,” she told reporters. ( The Sun ) Whether we label this AI psychosis , or simply a new expression of digital intimacy, one thing is clear: AI is no longer just a tool.

At its core, the APS AI Plan reimagines how government should function in the algorithmic age: faster, more transparent, and fundamentally people-first. It envisions a future where every public servant from policy officers to service delivery staff has access to secure generative AI tools, guided by rigorous ethical standards and continuous oversight. Unlike many private-sector AI strategies that chase efficiency alone, this Plan is built around public trust. It acknowledges that innovation in government cannot come at the cost of accountability and that the legitimacy of AI depends on its alignment with the values of democracy, equity, and transparency. In essence, the APS AI Plan is not just a digital transformation roadmap; it’s a governance statement , one that places ethics at the heart of automation. The Vision: AI for People, Not Policy Papers The Plan’s core ambition is clear, to “substantially increase the use of AI in government” in order to improve service delivery, policy outcomes, efficiency, and productivity. Yet, it does so through a deliberate moral framing: AI adoption must benefit people and protect them from harm . As articulated in the Statement of Intent on AI in the Australian Public Service , AI should be used to make lives better, improve government operations, and ensure benefits are shared equitably. The document sets out the government’s threefold AI ambition — to capture the opportunities of AI, spread the benefits widely, and keep Australians safe. This “people-first” lens distinguishes the Australian model from more aggressive AI modernization programs elsewhere. It underscores a governance philosophy rooted in social license building citizen trust through transparency, not technological inevitability. Building on Strong Foundations Before introducing new mechanisms, the plan acknowledges existing governance and legal pillars already anchoring responsible technology use in Australia. These include: The APS Code of Conduct and Values , ensuring integrity and accountability in all service delivery. The Privacy Act 1988 , governing data protection across agencies. The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) and Information Security Manual (ISM) , prescribing stringent data and systems safeguards. Oversight institutions like the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Australian Human Rights Commission , providing external accountability. On this foundation, the AI Plan introduces new, AI-specific instruments such as the Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government, the AI Impact Assessment Tool, AI Transparency Statements, and a forthcoming AI Review Committee to assess high-risk applications. Three Pillars of the APS AI Plan: Trust, People, and Tools The APS AI Plan 2025 is structured around three interdependent pillars — Trust , People , and Tools , forming a holistic governance framework. Trust: Transparency, Ethics, and Oversight At the heart of the plan lies the principle that public trust is non-negotiable. The Trust pillar introduces several initiatives to ensure that AI use in government is ethical, accountable, and transparent: AI in Government Policy Updates – Strengthening accountability and mandating risk assessments for high-impact AI applications. AI Review Committee – A new oversight body bringing together experts from across the APS, privacy regulators, and ombudsman offices to review sensitive or high-risk AI use cases. Clear Expectations for External Service Providers – Requiring contractors to disclose AI use in government projects and remain accountable for all AI-assisted work. AI Strategic Communications – A coordinated approach to communicate AI use, risks, and safeguards across the APS to foster internal and public confidence. Together, these mechanisms embed ethical guardrails and operational transparency — ensuring that every algorithmic decision is traceable and justifiable. People: Building a Responsible AI Workforce The People pillar is about cultural transformation — preparing a 150,000-strong APS workforce to adapt to an AI-enabled environment while preserving the human ethos of public service. It introduces: Foundational Learning – Mandatory AI literacy and safety training for all public servants, including senior leaders, to build digital fluency and ethical awareness. Consultation and Engagement – Requiring genuine dialogue with staff and unions before AI-driven workplace changes, safeguarding employee trust. AI Delivery and Enablement (AIDE) – A new multidisciplinary team to accelerate safe AI adoption across agencies, identify adoption barriers, and share best practices. Chief AI Officers (CAIOs) – Senior executives in every department tasked with driving adoption, ensuring compliance, and fostering collaboration across government. By mandating both top-down leadership and bottom-up participation, the plan aims to make AI adoption a shared journey rather than a bureaucratic imposition. Tools: Infrastructure for Secure AI Innovation No AI strategy can succeed without the right tools — and in this, the APS Plan takes a pragmatic and technical turn. T he Tools pillar focuses on infrastructure, data sovereignty, and equitable access: GovAI – A central, secure AI hosting platform offering agencies onshore access to vetted generative AI models (including a government-hosted GPT instance), reducing dependence on private vendors. GovAI Chat – A government-exclusive generative AI assistant, enabling every APS officer to use AI safely within secure parameters. Public and Enterprise AI Guidance – Policies for using tools like ChatGPT or Claude for “OFFICIAL-level” data, balancing innovation with security. AI Procurement Guidelines – Streamlined frameworks and new contractual clauses ensuring AI vendors adhere to government ethics and privacy standards. Intellectual Property Reuse Platform – A system allowing agencies to share AI-driven solutions and reduce redundancy. Central Register of AI Assessments – A repository of security and impact evaluations to speed up safe procurement. Whole-of-Government Cloud Policy – Supporting scalable, compliant, and data-sovereign AI infrastructure across agencies. This technical scaffolding ensures AI use is not just ambitious but operationally safe and cost-efficient. A Collaborative and Adaptive Governance Model The APS AI Plan explicitly recognises that AI governance cannot be static. With technologies evolving faster than regulatory frameworks, the Plan takes an adaptive and iterative approach one that welcomes feedback from employees, unions, and external stakeholders including academia and industry. Cross-sector collaboration will be central to maintaining relevance and inclusivity. Initiatives like GovHack , AI CoLab , and partnerships with the National AI Centre and research institutions will foster a broader ecosystem of innovation and accountability. Crucially, this flexibility mirrors an emerging trend in global AI governance , a shift from rigid compliance regimes to “learning systems” that evolve alongside technology. The APS Plan reflects this philosophy by embedding monitoring, feedback, and policy iteration as structural features, not afterthoughts. Assessment: A Model for Public-Sector AI Governance Viewed through a governance lens, the APS AI Plan 2025 represents a significant maturation of Australia’s digital policy architecture. It connects ethical aspirations with administrative execution , from training and procurement to oversight and risk management. Yet, its success will depend on three delicate balances : Innovation vs. Caution: The Plan aims to accelerate adoption but must avoid bureaucratic overregulation that stifles innovation. Centralization vs. Agency Autonomy: While frameworks like GovAI promise consistency, they risk homogenizing agency-specific innovation if too tightly controlled. Efficiency vs. Equity: Productivity gains must not come at the cost of workforce displacement or algorithmic bias. From a governance perspective, the Plan’s layered structure , combining ethical principles, procedural accountability, and technical standards , offers a robust model that could inspire other democracies grappling with the same dilemmas. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Human-Centred AI Governance The APS AI Plan 2025 marks a defining moment in Australia’s digital transformation journey , one that sees AI not as an end in itself, but as a means to renew public service around trust, equity, and competence. For global observers, the Plan embodies what effective AI governance looks like in practice: iterative, transparent, inclusive, and resolutely people-first. To conclude, governing AI is not about controlling machines , it is about designing systems that preserve human agency in the age of automation. The APS AI Plan, in that sense, may well be Australia’s most human policy yet.", "summary": "Australia’s AI Plan for the Australian Public Service (APS) 2025 sets a new benchmark in public-sector AI governance.

The case , first filed by GEMA in April 2024, accused OpenAI of allowing ChatGPT to reproduce protected lyrics verbatim, without obtaining a proper licence. After months of hearings and evidence submissions, the Munich court’s judgement on 11November, 2025 became the first in Europe to formally link AI-generated outputs to legal liability under copyright law. The court found that OpenAI’s ChatGPT unlawfully reproduced protected song lyrics represented by GEMA. The court also went a step further, ordering OpenAI to pay a licence fee for such use, and rejecting its defense that generative models merely “predict” text rather than “reproduce” creative content. This ruling sends a clear message : AI companies cannot claim technological neutrality when their systems distribute protected work. When did it all start? The case began in April 2024, when GEMA sued OpenAI after repeated instances where ChatGPT generated verbatim excerpts from copyrighted songs on user request , without licence, authorisation, or credit. GEMA accused OpenAI of profiting from creative works by using them both for model training and user interaction, all without engaging with established licensing systems. The company defended itself by claiming that ChatGPT does not “store” or “reproduce” works, but merely “predicts” text patterns based on probability. The judgment The Munich court dismantled that argument . It ruled that the method of generation is irrelevant when the outcome reproduces a protected work, making OpenAI directly liable for copyright infringement under German law. The judgment ordered OpenAI to pay a licence fee to GEMA, setting what the society called a Grundsatzurteil , a fundamental ruling with implications beyond national borders. For the first time, a court has explicitly linked AI-generated outputs to direct copyright liability, rather than focusing solely on the data used for training. For GEMA, the decision represents more than a legal victory; it is a moral one. In its statement following the verdict, the society reaffirmed that its aim was not to hinder technological progress but to ensure fairness. GEMA CEO Dr. Tobias Holzmüller said in the press release that, “The internet is not a self-service store, and human creative work is not a free template. Today, we have set a precedent that protects and clarifies the rights of copyright holders: Even operators of AI tools like ChatGPT must comply with copyright law”. His words echo a sentiment increasingly shared across Europe, where regulators are growing wary of unlicensed data extraction by AI companies under the guise of innovation. OpenAI has not yet issued a formal response but is widely expected to appeal. IMPLICATIONS OF THE JUDGMENT The ruling, however, lands at a particularly sensitive moment : the EU AI Act, set for full enforcement in 2026, already mandates transparency obligations regarding training data and copyright compliance. By treating AI-generated reproductions as actionable infringements, the Munich court has pre-emptively expanded the practical reach of those upcoming laws. For developers, the message is unmistakable: technical complexity cannot serve as a shield against ethical and legal accountability. The implications of this judgment stretch far beyond Germany. Other European jurisdictions, including France and Italy, are currently assessing similar complaints about AI models reproducing artistic and literary content. Legal experts expect this case to act as a template, guiding how courts interpret the responsibilities of generative AI systems under existing copyright frameworks. Even outside the EU, policymakers in countries like Canada and Japan have been watching closely as debates over fair use, consent, and training transparency intensify. Yet, at its core, the GEMA v. OpenAI judgment isn’t just about licensing or liability, it’s about redefining the social contract between human creators and the technologies that learn from them. It challenges the prevailing assumption that creative expression can be reduced to data and processed into derivative outputs free of moral or financial consequence. The Munich court has effectively stated what the law and ethics have long implied: innovation cannot exist in isolation from integrity. CONCLUSION For the AI ecosystem, this marks a turning point. The freewheeling era of “black-box creativity,” in which generative models could absorb and replicate human culture without accountability, may be coming to a close. If upheld on appeal, the ruling could inaugurate a new model of AI governance, one built on transparency, negotiated access, and respect for intellectual labour. At JustAI, we view this as a decisive moment in aligning artificial intelligence with human values. The verdict does not stifle innovation; it anchors it. The Munich court’s message is unambiguous: the future of AI will not be defined by how much it can generate, but by how responsibly it can create.", "summary": "In a historic judgment from Munich, the court ruled that OpenAI’s ChatGPT violated copyright by using song lyrics without proper licensing, marking a decisive moment in the global debate over AI training and intellectual property.

The exchange which is described by witnesses as cordial yet pointed , has since drawn worldwide attention for what it symbolises: a royal wake-up call about the pace and perils of artificial intelligence. The King approached Huang during the award ceremony at St James’s Palace, saying, “I need to talk to you,” before discreetly passing him a letter. Although the letter’s contents remain undisclosed, Huang later confirmed that it was related to artificial intelligence and reflected the King’s deep concern about the technology’s direction and societal implications. “He obviously cares very deeply about AI safety,” Huang told reporters after the event. “ It was a privilege to speak with him about the future of AI.” A Royal Voice in a Technological Debate For a monarch who has spent decades advocating environmental and ethical stewardship , King Charles’s engagement with AI feels both natural and necessary. His intervention builds on his remarks at the UK’s AI Safety Summit in 2023, where he had urged world leaders and technologists to ensure that artificial intelligence “remains a force for good rather than a tool for harm.” At a time when AI models are rapidly advancing in capability and scale, his renewed message carries unusual weight. This was not merely a polite royal interaction but a statement of intent — an insistence that moral responsibility and innovation must coexist. In the King’s view, technology must evolve within ethical boundaries, and leaders in AI must be answerable to the societies they reshape. The symbolism of the moment was unmistakable. Here was the British sovereign, steeped in centuries of institutional continuity, confronting the CEO of the company that has become the engine of the modern AI revolution. Nvidia’s chips now power almost every leading AI model in existence — from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini. In handing Huang a private note, the King was, in effect, addressing the entire AI eco system. Jensen Huang’s Response Huang, who is often described as one of Silicon Valley’s most influential technologists, appeared both amused and humbled by the exchange. Speaking later to The Economic Times , he revealed that the King had handed him a letter that included excerpts from his earlier AI speech — a gentle but pointed way of saying that the conversation was not over. “The King said there are a lot of bad actors around and that things are changing very rapidly,” Huang recalled. “He’s clearly paying attention.” The Nvidia chief has long maintained that while AI offers extraordinary benefits — from drug discovery to climate modelling — it also carries grave responsibilities. In recent months, he has warned that the global race to dominate AI could spiral into strategic competition between the United States and China, calling for “balance between innovation, openness and safeguards.” That same balance appears to be at the heart of the King’s message as well. Why This Moment Matters? What makes this exchange more than royal theatre is its timing. The AI industry is at an inflection point: governments are still struggling to frame coherent regulation, tech companies are moving faster than policy can catch up, and public anxiety about AI’s social consequences , from deepfakes to disinformation , continues to rise. King Charles’s gesture therefore represents a quiet yet powerful intervention in the global debate on AI ethics and governance. It highlights the fact that AI is no longer a niche topic confined to laboratories or boardrooms; it is a societal issue that demands leadership across institutions, including those as traditional as the monarchy. His message echoes a growing international chorus. The European Union’s AI Act, the U.S. AI Action Plan, and India’s proposed AI Mission all converge on one point, that artificial intelligence cannot be left to market forces alone. The King’s symbolic act translates that same concern into moral language, reframing the issue as one of stewardship and duty rather than mere technical optimisation. Ethics Meets Power The conversation between King Charles and Jensen Huang also exposes the asymmetry between technological power and governance. Nvidia, whose market value now exceeds a trillion dollars, supplies the core hardware that underpins the world’s AI infrastructure. The chips it designs effectively determine who has access to advanced computation and who does not shaping economies, military capabilities, and the next generation of digital intelligence. In that context, the King’s note reads as a moral nudge directed not at an individual but at the entire technological order. The message is clear: innovation that outpaces reflection risks destabilising the very societies it seeks to empower. It is also worth remembering that this isn’t the first time King Charles has raised the alarm on a global issue before it entered mainstream political discourse. Long before climate change became a central policy concern, he was among its most persistent advocates. His intervention in the AI debate could prove similarly prescient. Between Symbolism and Substance Critics may view the exchange as largely ceremonial , after all, a handwritten royal note is not policy. Yet symbolism has its own form of influence, especially when it amplifies questions of responsibility in a field that often moves faster than ethics can catch up. By engaging directly with Huang, King Charles is effectively telling the tech world that moral authority still has a place at the table. His warning , gentle but unmistakable complements growing public pressure on AI firms to disclose their training data, mitigate bias, and curb misinformation. It also aligns with calls from academics, civil-society groups and think tanks urging the creation of binding frameworks for AI accountability. In that sense, this exchange was less about monarchy meeting technology and more about humanity meeting its mirror. The King’s reminder to “talk” is a reminder to listen , to the fears, hopes, and ethical questions surrounding artificial intelligence before it evolves beyond human control. A Conversation That Must Continue Whether or not the contents of the King’s letter are ever made public, its impact is already evident. It has reignited debate about AI governance and underscored the need for moral clarity in a field that is increasingly opaque. In a world where algorithms influence elections, economies and everyday behaviour, the message could not be timelier: leadership in AI is not just about who builds the fastest model but who asks the hardest questions. King Charles’s private note to Jensen Huang may never enter the public record, but it has already entered history as a moment that brought conscience face to face with computation.", "summary": "King Charles III handed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang a personal letter during the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering ceremony — a gesture that has since sparked global conversation about the moral direction of artificial intelligence.", "published_date": "2025-11-11T10:20:23", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.177860", "tags": [291], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "KING CHARLES III’S AI WARNING TO NVIDIA’S JENSEN HUANG: A ROYAL REMINDER ON RESPONSIBILITY (11.11.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/king-charles-iiis-ai-warning-to-nvidias-jensen-huang-a-royal-reminder-on-responsibility-11-11-25/"}}

The curtain-raiser, held on 7 November 2025 at the chancery premises of the Consulate General of India, Seattle, reaffirmed India’s ambition to steer the next wave of AI development under a people- and planet-centric rubric. Agenda & Themes: People · Planet · Progress The foundational motto of the Summit — People, Planet and Progress — was front and centre during the Seattle gathering. Industry and government voices emphasised that AI should not simply be about efficiency or competition, but rather about inclusive growth, environmental sustainability , and measurable outcomes. In further detail, the summit website maps this motto into a set of “Seven Chakras” (core domains) for global cooperation: Safe & Trusted AI Human Capital Science, Resilience & Innovation Inclusion & Social Empowerment Democratising AI Resources Economic Growth & Social Good Climate/Planet component These are designed to translate high-level ambition into actionable pillars. ( impact.indiaai.gov.in ) Seattle Roundtable Highlights At the Seattle event, tech-CEOs from the Greater Seattle area, U.S. congressional representatives and Indian diplomatic officials engaged in frank discussions on how the Summit might catalyse tangible deployments of AI — especially in domains like agri-tech, digital infrastructure and data-centre ecosystems. Notably: U.S. law-makers including Adam Smith (Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee) and Michael Baumgartner (Member, House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees) were briefed on India’s AI progress narrative. The even t showcased India’s capabilities in scaling data-centre infrastructure and deploying AI in agriculture, especially relevant in addressing food-security, supply-chain optimisation and rural inclusion. The event was explicitly positioned as the first of several pre-Summit sessions: further workshops are expected in early 2026 with universities and major AI/tech firms. Why It Matters for India and the Global South This initiative is significant for several reasons: It marks India hosting a global-scale AI summit with the Global South in focus. According to reports, India will be the first in that category on this scale. The emphasis on “impact” rather than purely governance or safety reflects a shift in international AI discourse: moving from risk-mitigation to real-world outcomes (economic, social, environmental) especially for developing countries. India is signalling its intent not only to host, but to lead collaborative frameworks around AI that deliver tangible benefits — a narrative of “AI for All”, especially for the underserved and underserved geographies. Key Takeaways & Critical Questions Takeaways: The Seattle event successfully launched momentum, building bilateral and multilateral interest well ahead of the main event. By using the three-pillar motto and “Seven Chakras”, the initiative frames AI in a way that transcends typical techno-optimism or regulatory anxiety alone. There is early alignment between Indian diplomacy, U.S. tech stakeholders and lawmakers — potentially paving the way for cross-border partnerships in AI infrastructure, R&D and deployment. Critical Questions & Gaps: While the vision is expansive, the devil lies in execution: how will India and partners convert “impact” into measurable metrics, especially in developing contexts? There remains the tension between regulation vs innovation. India’s ambition to democratise AI must reconcile with concerns of bias, data-rights, transparency and governance — especially when scaling globally. The global South focus is important, but many developing countries still lack digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks or human capital. How will the Summit address capacity-building, not only rhetoric? As India positions itself as a hub, questions of inclusion arise: Will innovation benefit only urban or privileged actors, or genuinely reach rural populations, marginalised groups and low-income geographies? Looking Ahead: The Road to February 2026 In the months leading up to the main summit in Delhi: Additional workshops and briefings will firm up stakeholder commitments, partnerships and use-case pilots. (As indicated in Seattle’s announcement.) The themes of People, Planet and Progress will need to be translated into actionable session tracks, deliverables and post-event outcomes. For the legal-policy community (relevant for our audience at JustAI): scrutiny of how frameworks for safe and trusted AI—and by extension, governance of agentic AI—are incorporated will be vital. The Summit may prove to be a platform where policy, regulation and innovation intersect. There will be global eyes on how the Global South is represented, engaged and benefitted — India’s hosting role will bring both opportunity and responsibility. Implications for the Legal-AI Ecosystem For the legal and compliance community, especially those monitoring AI’s evolution: The emphasis on “safe & trusted AI” signals that regulatory discussions will be part of the conversation, though framed in an outcome-orientation rather than purely risk-aversion. The democratisation of AI resources suggests increased focus on access, ethics, and perhaps legal frameworks around data sharing, infrastructure deployment and cross-border innovation. Given India’s readiness to host large-scale AI convenings, we may see announcements relating to: standard-setting initiatives, public-private partnerships, and international cooperation mechanisms — all of which may have legal and compliance ramifications. For our own domain of AI in the legal profession: the Summit may open avenues around AI tools in law, regulation of legal-tech, and cross-jurisdictional collaborations — aligning with themes like human capital, inclusion, and economic growth in legal services. Conclusion The Seattle curtain-raiser for the India-AI Impact Summit 2026 has crystallised a bold narrative: AI as a driver for inclusive growth, sustainability and measurable progress — not just novelty or risk-management. With the support of technology stakeholders, policymakers and global partners, India is staking a claim as a convenor of the next big chapter in AI governance and deployment. Yet, as always with ambitious summits, the real test lies in deliverables : whether the rhetoric of People-Planet-Progress becomes concrete action, especially for those at the margins, and whether frameworks are built to govern emerging AI systems, especially agentic AI—that may challenge human autonomy and oversight. At JustAI, we will continue to track how this unfolds: from partnership announcements to policy frameworks, and from R&D to real-world impact. The road to February 2026 is set : the question now is, who will be sitting at the table, and what will they leave behind?", "summary": "Curtain raiser in Seattle for the India AI summit, 2026.", "published_date": "2025-11-08T13:07:15", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.190445", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "CURTAIN-RAISER FOR THE INDIA AI IMPACT SUMMIT 2026: FOCUS ON PEOPLE, PLANET & PROGRESS (8.11.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/curtain-raiser-for-the-india-ai-impact-summit-2026-focus-on-people-planet-progress-8-11-25/"}}

At first glance, this may look like a typical intellectual-property or access-control dispute. But beneath the surface lies a deeper tension between two visions of the digital economy: one dominated by tightly controlled platforms, and another shaped by intelligent, autonomous agents acting directly on behalf of users. The Case That’s Stirring the AI Market Filed on 5 November 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the lawsuit ( Amazon.com Services LLC v. Perplexity AI Inc. ) accuses Perplexity of enabling “unauthorised automated interactions” with Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon’s complaint describes Comet as an AI-powered shopping assistant that can log into users’ accounts, search for products, compare prices and even place orders — all while disguising itself as a regular human user. The company claims this behaviour breaches its Terms of Service, which prohibit the use of “robots, spiders or other data-gathering tools” to access its site. It also argues that Comet creates consumer-protection and cybersecurity risks, interferes with Amazon’s quality-control systems and threatens the integrity of its marketplace. According to Business Standard’s report, Amazon issued multiple cease-and-desist notices before resorting to legal action, alleging that Perplexity deliberately bypassed blocks meant to stop Comet from functioning. Perplexity, on the other hand, calls the lawsuit “corporate intimidation.” In statements to The Guardian and The Hindu , the company defended Comet as a privacy-respecting agent that never stores user credentials on its own servers. It insists that Comet only acts on behalf of users who have granted explicit permission , and that Amazon’s attempt to block it amounts to an attack on user autonomy. Platform Power vs. User Agency This isn’t just a question of who can automate online shopping. It’s about whether the internet will evolve into a closed ecosystem policed by major platforms, or an open environment where users , through their chosen AI agents , can act freely. Amazon’s position represents the platform-centric model that has defined the digital economy for two decades: control access, mediate every interaction, and monetise every user action. Perplexity’s Comet embodies a newer paradigm , one where AI agents become independent intermediaries between humans and the web. If Amazon wins, it reinforces the notion that users can only interact with online services through the interfaces and APIs authorised by the platform. If Perplexity prevails, it could open the door for a generation of “agentic” AI tools capable of performing real-world tasks from ordering groceries to booking travel without direct user clicks. The clash therefore isn’t about scraping data or violating a user agreement. It’s about who gets to control the flow of digital labour: the platform, or the person represented by their AI agent. The Legal Grey Zone of ‘Agentic’ AI Legally, the dispute sits in uncharted territory. Traditional computer-access laws were built around human actors using automated scripts or bots. But when an AI agent acts as a true extension of a human, using their credentials, following their intent, and making real purchases, it blurs the boundary between “unauthorised access” and “delegated authority.” Can a company claim that a user’s own AI assistant is trespassing on their account? Does a platform have the right to deny access to a digital proxy acting for a legitimate account holder? These are not hypothetical questions. As generative and agentic AI systems evolve, they will increasingly perform tasks once reserved for humans , managing finances, executing contracts, and negotiating prices. Yet, as this case shows, the law hasn’t yet decided whether such agents are independent entities, or simply “extensions of the user’s will.” What’s at Stake? For Amazon, the case is existentially tied to its business model. A shopping agent that can skip promoted listings and paid placements directly threatens the economics of Amazon’s marketplace. Its algorithms, advertising architecture, and recommendation engines all depend on keeping the user within its controlled environment. Allowing third-party agents to autonomously navigate and purchase products could dismantle that model, reducing visibility for sponsored products and breaking the data feedback loops that drive Amazon’s advertising revenue. For Perplexity, this is about survival and principle. The startup has positioned Comet as the next step in human-AI collaboration: an assistant that doesn’t just suggest, but acts. In an open letter, the company accused Amazon of “trying to outlaw the future of personal AI,” arguing that users have the right to choose how they interact with online platforms , whether through a mouse, voice command, or AI agent. The Broader Policy Vacuum The case also exposes the vacuum in global AI governance. Regulators from Brussels to Washington are drafting laws on AI transparency, bias, and accountability but few frameworks address autonomous economic agents . Who regulates an AI that spends money, negotiates deals, or enters into transactions? Should such systems be required to identify themselves to online platforms? And when they act on behalf of a user, who bears the responsibility if something goes wrong, the agent’s developer, the user, or the platform hosting the transaction? These questions will soon dominate digital-policy discussions. If the court recognises agentic AI as a legitimate user proxy, it may push regulators to create new categories of “digital agents” with defined rights and obligations. If not, platforms could be empowered to gatekeep AI access, limiting innovation to those who play by their proprietary rules. What Comes Next? Legal analysts expect the case to turn on two points: Whether Comet’s automated behaviour qualifies as a breach of Amazon’s Terms of Service or a violation of anti-circumvention laws; and Whether a user’s authorisation can legitimise an AI’s access, even if the platform disapproves. A narrow ruling might focus only on contractual compliance. A broader one could set precedent on digital personhood, user autonomy, and the very definition of “access” in the age of machine intermediaries. Either way, Amazon v. Perplexity will be remembered as one of the first courtroom tests of agentic AI. It’s not just about shopping carts, it’s about who truly controls the digital economy when machines start to act on our behalf.

Released under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) , the G uidelines mark a pivotal moment in India’s AI journey. They position the country as a global thought leader in balancing AI innovation with accountability and ethics, aligning with the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 and the national principle of AI for All . Seven Sutras: India’s Ethical Foundation for AI At the heart of the document lie seven guiding sutras – Trust is the Foundation – Building confidence across developers, deployers, and citizens. People First – Ensuring human-centric design, oversight, and empowerment. Innovation over Restraint – Encouraging responsible progress over excessive caution. Fairness & Equity – Preventing bias and promoting inclusive growth. Accountability – Defining clear responsibilities across the AI value chain. Understandable by Design – Promoting transparency and explainability. Safety, Resilience & Sustainability – Building systems that are robust and environmentally conscious. These foundational principles serve as India’s ethical compass, promoting human-centric AI systems that are transparent, equitable, and trustworthy. They seek to embed human oversight, social inclusion, and environmental consciousness into the design and deployment of AI technologies. A Three-Domain Framework The Guidelines operate across three key domains : Enablement , Regulation , and Oversight , supported by six strategic pillars: Infrastructure: Expanding access to GPUs, national datasets, and leveraging Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Capacity Building: Enhancing AI literacy, upskilling citizens, and training regulators. Policy & Regulation: Reviewing existing laws to ensure agility and balance in rulemaking. Risk Mitigation: Developing India-specific frameworks and a national AI Incidents Database . Accountability: Establishing graded liability systems and grievance redressal mechanisms. Institutions: Creating the AI Governance Group (AIGG) , Technology & Policy Expert Committee (TPEC) , and AI Safety Institute (AISI) to oversee implementation. Together, these form a “whole-of-government” approach to AI governance — uniting ministries, regulators, and experts under one coordinated vision. India’s existing strengths in Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) such as Aadhaar, UPI, and DigiLocker are placed at the centre of this approach, providing a scalable and secure foundation for AI development and adoption. One of the most pragmatic aspects of the framework is its clear stance that India does not require a standalone AI law—at least not yet . Instead, it argues that the current legal ecosystem, including the Information Technology Act , the Digital Personal Data Protection Act , and consumer protection and criminal laws, can already address most AI-related risks. These range from deepfakes and data misuse to algorithmic bias and misinformation. The report nonetheless calls for targeted legal amendments to clarify the classification of AI actors, define liability within the AI value chain, and address contentious copyright issues related to AI training on protected data. This “no new law yet” approach reflects India’s belief in agile regulation , one that evolves with technology rather than constraining it. It allows innovation to flourish while maintaining the flexibility to intervene when risks become apparent. In keeping with India’s legacy of technology-enabled governance, the Guidelines adopt a techno-legal approach . Concepts such as DEPA for AI Training , privacy-preserving architectures, and watermarking f or content authentication are proposed to embed compliance, auditability, and accountability directly into the design of AI systems. These measures echo India’s broader digital philosophy: that law and technology should reinforce one another to ensure trust at scale. A central focus of the framework is risk mitigation . The Guidelines categorise AI risks into areas such as malicious use, bias and discrimination, transparency failures, systemic threats, and national security concerns. To address these, they propose a national AI Incidents Reporting Mechanism to collect and analyse data on real-world harms, supported by voluntary compliance frameworks and human oversight requirements in critical sectors. Institutionally, the Guidelines envision a coordinated governance ecosystem anchored by three key entities: the AI Governance Group (AIGG) to drive national policy and coordination; the Technology and Policy Expert Committee (TPEC) to provide strategic and technical guidance; and the AI Safety Institute (AISI) to conduct safety testing, risk research, and international collaboration. These bodies will work alongside regulators such as the RBI, SEBI, TRAI, and CCI to ensure accountability while supporting innovation across sectors. Globally, the Guidelines highlight the growing importance of AI diplomacy as a pillar of India’s foreign policy. They call for deeper engagement in multilateral forums such as the G20, OECD, and UNESCO , and for India to lead by example through the AI Impact Summit 2026 . The report also acknowledges emerging challenges from next-generation “agentic” AI systems that can act autonomously, recommending foresight research and horizon scanning to ensure governance frameworks remain future-ready. The Action Plan outlined in the report sets out a phased approach. In the short term, the focus will be on establishing institutional frameworks, developing risk assessment models, and launching public awareness initiatives. The medium-term priorities include piloting regulatory sandboxes and amending existing laws, while the long-term goal is to draft AI-specific legislation if emerging risks demand it. The India AI Governance Guidelines mark a shift from reactive regulation to anticipatory governance —one that blends ethics, innovation, and foresight.

The Judiciary of England and Wales has issued detailed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Guidance for Judicial Office Holders , outlining when and how AI can be used by judges, tribunal members, and their staff. Released on 31 October 2025, the new guidance replaces the April edition and sets a firmer tone on confidentiality, accuracy, and personal accountability. Far from an endorsement of AI, the document reads as a cautionary framework —acknowledging the technology’s usefulness while warning against its uncritical adoption. Its central principle remains uncompromising: no technological tool may compromise the integrity of justice. Guardrails for an AI-Assisted Judiciary The 2025 guidance marks a turning point in the judiciary’s engagement with technology. While courts in the UK already use AI-assisted tools in document review and case management, this is the first time judicial officers have been given formal boundaries for using generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Meta AI. The guidance calls for a sober understanding of how these systems actually work. Large Language Models, it explains, “do not retrieve facts from verified databases” but generate sentences based on statistical prediction. This makes them capable of fluency but not of truth. Put simply, AI chatbots can write persuasively—and be wrong. Judicial officers are advised to treat their output as “non-definitive” and always verify facts through official legal sources. The document even cautions that some AI tools display an “Americanised view of law,” drawing heavily from US legal data rather than UK jurisprudence. Confidentiality Is Non-Negotiable The guidance is blunt on privacy: do not enter anything confidential into an AI tool. Judicial officers are reminded that information typed into public chatbots “should be seen as published to all the world.” Even when chat history is turned off, it should be assumed that data may still be retained or disclosed. To prevent breaches, judges are instructed to disable data-sharing features, use only official devices, and report any accidental disclosure as a data incident. The warning extends even to mobile app permissions—urging officers to deny access requests from AI tools to contacts, files, or device data. This insistence on privacy reflects a deeper concern: if judicial data fuels commercial AI systems, public confidence in impartial justice could erode beyond repair. Accuracy, Bias, and Human Judgment T he new framework goes beyond cautionary notes —it reiterates a judicial philosophy: accountability cannot be automated . Judges remain personally responsible for everything issued in their name, even if AI assisted in drafting or research. The guidance describes “hallucinations”—a term borrowed from AI research—as a real and recurring risk. Fabricated citations, misquoted legislation, or invented precedents are not rare, it warns. As such, every AI-assisted output must be verified manually before use. The document also raises the issue of bias, noting that AI systems inherit distortions from the data they are trained on. Judicial officers are urged to remain alert to cultural and demographic bias, referencing the Equal Treatment Bench Book as a resource for ensuring fairness when dealing with AI-generated text or evidence. Anticipating AI Use in Litigation In a prescient move, the guidance acknowledges that AI-generated material is already finding its way into courtrooms —sometimes through legal professionals, and increasingly through self-represented litigants. Judges are encouraged to inquire where submissions appear to contain AI-generated text—often identifiable by American spelling, irrelevant case citations, or highly polished but inaccurate prose. In such cases, litigants should be reminded of their responsibility for the accuracy of what they submit. The guidance also highlights the emergence of “white text” (hidden machine-readable prompts) and deepfakes as new threats to judicial integrity, warning that forged or manipulated materials may now reach courts in digital disguise. Where AI Can and Cannot “Assist” ? The guidance draws a clear line between permissible and prohibited uses of AI in judicial work. AI tools may be used for: Drafting administrative communications (emails, memos, presentations). Summarising large bodies of text for internal review. Assisting with meeting transcription and scheduling. But they must not be used for: Conducting legal research to discover new information. Analysing legal questions or drafting judicial reasoning. Reviewing evidence without direct human engagement. In short, AI can help judges manage workload—but not make decisions. It can summarise, not substitute. A Judiciary that Leads, Not Follows While global debates around AI in justice often focus on automation, the UK judiciary’s approach is deliberately conservative, rooted in human oversight, ethical prudence, and public transparency. By publicly releasing this document, the judiciary signals that its legitimacy depends not only on adopting technology, but on constraining it. The goal is not to reject AI, but to domesticate it—to ensure that efficiency never eclipses independence. The closing line of the guidance encapsulates this balance: “Judges must always read the underlying documents. AI tools may assist, but they cannot replace direct judicial engagement with evidence.” In an age where algorithms increasingly mediate knowledge, this guidance reaffirms a principle older than the law itself: justice must be humanly reasoned, and humanly accountable.

The case has sparked widespread outrage and renewed debate over the urgent need to regulate misuse of AI technologies in India. According to reports, the victim, identified as Rahul Bharti , had been receiving AI-generated nude photos and obscene videos showing him and his three sisters for nearly two weeks. The accused , identified as a man named Sahil in the police complaint , allegedly demanded ₹20,000 and threatened to circulate the doctored content on social media if the money was not paid. WHEN AI BECOMES A WEAPON OF SILENCE In a grim reminder of how generative AI can be weaponised, a 19-year-old college student, Rahul Bharti (name as reported), died by suicide in Faridabad, Haryana, after being allegedly blackmailed with AI-generated obscene images and videos of his three sisters. According to his father, Rahul had for about two weeks been receiving AI-morphed nude photos and videos of himself and his sisters, after his phone was hacked. The perpetrator, identified in the complaint as “Sahil” demanded ₹20,000 and threatened to release the content on social media if the amount was not paid. In his final conversations the blackmailer reportedly also taunted Rahul to kill himself, naming substances and methods. Rahul consumed sulpha tablets at around 7 pm on a Saturday; his family rushed him to hospital, but he died during treatment. The case is being investigated by the Old Faridabad police station, with the mobile phone being forensically examined and at least two persons named in the FIR under abetment to suicide (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 s. 108). A NEW FRONTIER OF CYBER-EXTORTION What makes this case especially concerning for the AI governance community is the use of AI-generated deepfakes as the vehicle for extortion, rather than purely stolen personal data or actual intimate imagery. In effect: The hacker (or hackers) created morphed nude photos and videos of Rahul and his sisters using artificial intelligence. These were then used as leverage: pay up, or we’ll publish them and ruin your family’s reputation. The victim’s father says the accused also encouraged suicide. The victim’s behaviour changed: he withdrew, stopped eating, isolated himself, classic signs of acute distress under prolonged harassment. This is not just a personal tragedy, it is a profound warning about the governance risks in a world where deepfakes are cheaply produced, difficult to trace, and carry high emotional and reputational costs for the victim. As the investigating officer put it: “This case is a serious example of cybercrime and the misuse of AI technology.” A PATTERN OF TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOITATION This tragedy adds to a growing list of incidents across India involving deepfake abuse , from doctored celebrity images to fake revenge porn. But this case is perhaps the most chilling example of how such technology can be weaponised to push a young person into despair. Experts note that AI-driven image morphing and deepfake porn are emerging as a new category of cyber-extortion, targeting both men and women. The victims are often unaware that the images are fabricated and feel trapped by shame and fear of social stigma. “Deepfake technology has taken cyber harassment to a new level,” says Delhi-based cyber law expert Advocate Rakshit Tandon. “In the past, blackmailers used hacked data or real photos. Now, with AI, they can create synthetic images that are almost impossible to disprove instantly. The psychological damage is immense.” The Legal and Policy Gap While Indian law criminalises extortion, online harassment, and publishing obscene material under the IT Act and IPC/BNS provisions, there is no explicit legislation addressing deepfake creation or distribution . The absence of targeted regulation leaves victims vulnerable and complicates prosecution. The proposed amendments to India’s IT Rules — which the government recently announced to curb deepfakes — could fill some of these gaps, but as this case shows, enforcement remains a major challenge. Identifying the creator of an AI-generated image requires specialised forensic tools and international cooperation, especially when data is hosted on foreign servers or encrypted platforms. For police forces still catching up with conventional cybercrime, deepfake-related offences represent a new and technically demanding frontier. “Most police stations lack the capacity to verify AI-generated content. Without expert intervention, it’s difficult to establish that the images were fabricated,” says a senior cybercrime official in Gurugram. The Human Cost of AI Misuse Behind the legal complexities lies the human toll. Rahul’s death is not an isolated case of digital harassment , it reflects a broader crisis of mental health, social shame, and technological vulnerability . The family told media outlets that Rahul had become unusually quiet and fearful in the days before the incident. “He stopped eating properly. He kept saying someone would destroy our lives,” his father said, fighting tears. The incident also exposes the lack of institutional support for victims of digital blackmail. While cybercrime helplines and grievance portals exist, few victims have the emotional or legal strength to navigate the process , especially when fake sexual content is involved. A Tragic Reminder Rahul Bharti’s death is a tragic reminder that technology, when misused, can turn from innovation to intimidation in an instant. His case should not be remembered as another cybercrime statistic but as a wake-up call for policymakers, AI developers, and citizens alike. As India moves toward becoming an AI-driven economy, safeguarding the dignity, privacy, and safety of individuals must become as much a priority as promoting digital innovation.

On 22 October 2025, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released a draft amendment to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, seeking to bring “synthetically generated information” — commonly known as deepfakes — within the fold of legal regulation. The proposed rules aim to introduce the country’s first formal regulatory framework for synthetically generated information, a term that encompasses AI-created or manipulated media that appears authentic to the viewer. The ministry’s draft, now open for public consultatio n until 6 November 2025, marks a crucial moment in India’s evolving digital-governance landscape. For the first time, the government has directly addressed the risks emerging from AI-generated content, signalling a move to balance innovation with accountability in the era of deep learning and algorithmic media creation. Why the amendment is required? The ministry’s explanatory note acknowledges that the availability of generative AI tools has triggered a surge in deepfake videos, synthetic images, and impersonation-based content capable of manipulating elections, spreading misinformation, or damaging reputations. Such content—often indistinguishable from reality has exposed significant gaps in the current regulatory system, which was designed for traditional user-generated data rather than machine-generated fabrications. By extending the due-diligence obligations under the IT Rules to platforms that create, modify, or host synthetic content, the government seeks to pre-empt potential misuse while ensuring that India’s digital ecosystem remains, in MeitY’s words, “open, safe, trusted, and accountable.” Inside the Draft: Defining Synthetic Information and Mandating Labels The proposed amendment i ntroduces, for the first time, a legal definition of “synthetically generated information”, covering any content created or altered using a computer resource that “reasonably appears to be authentic or true.” This seemingly simple phrasing carries broad implications: it brings AI-generated audio, video, and visual media squarely under the compliance umbrella of the IT Rules, 2021. In practical terms, MeitY proposes a labelling and metadata regime requiring that all such synthetic content be clearly marked to distinguish it from authentic media. The draft mandates that the identifiers visual or auditory must occupy at least 10 percent of the display area or the initial duration of audio, ensuring users can easily recognise manipulated material. Platforms enabling the creation or modification of AI-based media will have to embed unique identifiers or metadata tags that remain visible or traceable across the lifecycle of the content. Furthermore, significant social media intermediaries (SSMIs)—large platforms such as video-sharing and messaging services—will need to implement technical verification systems to determine whether uploaded material is synthetically generated. Users may be required to declare whether their content is AI-created, after which the platform must attach an appropriate label or watermark. These measures together are intended to strengthen transparency, limit impersonation risks, and promote informed consumption of online content. Deepfake Governance within the Larger AI Policy Landscape The proposed amendments do not arrive in isolation. They align with India’s ongoing efforts to build a coherent framework for AI governance, complementing the forthcoming National AI Mission and the broader Digital India programme. While other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and the United States, debate dedicated AI acts or model bills, India appears to be embedding AI accountability within existing digital-governance structures rather than creating standalone legislation. This integrated approach has advantages. It enables faster rule-making under established IT mechanisms and ensures that AI-generated content is subject to the same legal duties as user-generated content, including takedown and due-diligence requirements. However, it also blurs the boundary between AI-specific and platform-specific obligations, potentially complicating enforcement and compliance strategies for intermediaries. For India’s rapidly growing AI ecosystem, this move sends a clear message: ethical design, transparency, and traceability are no longer optional. Companies building or deploying generative-AI systems must now consider compliance by design, embedding labelling features and audit trails into their products to avoid regulatory risk. Intent behind the proposed Amendment: Accountability vs. Innovation While the intent behind the draft amendment is clear, its implementation challenges may prove complex. Embedding immutable metadata or visible identifiers across multiple formats, text, audio, video, will demand significant technical upgrades from platforms, especially smaller intermediaries lacking advanced AI detection tools. The threat of losing “safe harbour” protection under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 for non-compliance could drive intermediaries to adopt over-cautious moderation practices, risking over-blocking or removal of legitimate creative content. Civil-liberties experts have already cautioned that without procedural safeguards and clear appeal mechanisms, stricter takedown provisions could inadvertently chill free expression online. Moreover, the draft’s definition of synthetic information, while broad, centres on visual and audio media, leaving ambiguity around text-based generative outputs—such as AI-written essays, news, or code. As generative-AI tools diversify, regulators may soon face pressure to clarify how these textual outputs fit within the proposed framework. Another unresolved issue lies in cross-platform interoperability. Global intermediaries operate across multiple jurisdictions, each with different labelling and traceability standards. India’s insistence on visible identifiers covering 10 percent of display space may not align with technical frameworks used internationally, creating compliance friction for global platforms. A Step Towards Transparent AI Use — If Executed Right Despite these concerns, the proposed amendment represents an important normative shift. It acknowledges that AI systems have moved beyond mere innovation and into the domain of social impact and public risk. By introducing traceability and disclosure obligations, the government is attempting to rebuild digital trust at a time when misinformation, impersonation, and algorithmic manipulation threaten the integrity of online discourse. The amendment also follows a global trend: nations are increasingly demanding machine-readable provenance markers for AI-generated content, echoing initiatives such as the Content Authenticity Initiative and the EU AI Act’s labelling obligations. If implemented effectively, India’s draft could serve as a regulatory model for other emerging economies, demonstrating how AI accountability can be pursued without stalling innovation. CONCLUSION The dr aft amendments to the IT Rules mark a critical inflection point for India’s digital governance framework. Up until now, content regulation, intermediary liability and platform enforcement have often been reactive and foisted onto platforms through ad-hoc notices and advisories. With these changes, we see a proactive, technology-aware, and regulation -embedded turn , one that acknowledges generative AI not just as a tool but as a source of regulatory risk. By defining synthetic media, mandating labelling, embedding identifiers and tightening takedown regimes, the government is signalling that the era of unchecked online intermediaries and untraceable AI-generated content is nearing its end. For the tech ecosystem, this means compliance is moving from desirable to mandatory. For users, it promises more transparency (though not necessarily more simplicity). For regulators, it underscores the challenge of keeping pace with AI’s rapid evolution. Yet the regulatory environment must walk a fine line: ensuring accountability without stifling innovation; protecting rights without enabling over-censorship; building oversight without creating chilling effects. The next few months stakeholder feedback, finalisation of rules, implementation timelines , will determine whether this shift yields a robust, balanced regime or simply more compliance burdens. For the AI and law community that we at JustAI closely monitor, these developments presage several lines of enquiry: the efficacy of labelling regimes, the architecture of metadata tracing, the liability contours for AI-tool providers, and the impact on generative-AI deployment in India. In that sense, the rules are more than regulatory change: they are a test-bed for how a major democracy seeks to govern the next frontier of synthetic content and platform accountability. We will continue to dissect the final rules, monitor the consultation outcomes, and track how platforms respond. The era of deepfakes may not be over , but for now, the field of play is changing.

Unveiled in October 2025, the guidance aims to help Australian organizations adopt AI technologies safely and ethically by outlining six essential practices shaped by national and international ethics principles. Overview of the Guidance The guidance is offered in two tailored versions: Foundations , which targets organizations new to AI adoption, and Implementation Practices , designed for governance professionals and technical experts who seek to embed responsible AI use deeply within their operations. This dual approach ensures accessibility while providing robust, actionable frameworks for varying levels of AI maturity. What Sets Australia’s Guidance Apart Unlike generic AI policy statements seen elsewhere, Australia’s approach is highly focused on actionable and tailored practices across the lifecycle of AI systems. The guidance is split into two versions: “Foundations” for organizations new to AI, and “Implementation Practices” for technical and governance teams. This dual structure ensures accessibility and depth, enabling organizations at different stages of AI maturity to embed ethical governance directly into their operational models. Central to this guidance are six essential practices distilled from international and national ethical standards. These practices address the full spectrum of AI risk—data governance, model transparency, auditability, and human oversight—offering stakeholders a roadmap for deploying AI responsibly. This is not just theory; standards are designed to be pragmatic, breaking adoption into clear phases and checklist requirements that translate into day-to-day operational controls. Core Practices and Tools Central to Australia’s guidance are six essential practices that organizations are encouraged to adopt: Clearly deciding accountability for AI systems Understanding and planning for AI impacts Measuring and managing associated risks Sharing essential information transparently Rigorous testing and ongoing monitoring Maintaining human control over AI decisions To facilitate adoption, the National AI Centre has also introduced practical tools including an AI screening tool, policy guides, templates for AI registers, and a clear glossary—aimed especially at lowering barriers for small and medium enterprises. Insights into Australia’s Proposal Australia’s guidance exemplifies a principled yet pragmatic model for AI governance. It steers away from imposing heavy-handed regulations immediately, instead favoring an advisory, principles-led framework that complements existing laws such as the Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Consumer Law. This strategy balances the need for innovation agility with comprehensive risk management. By emphasizing a whole-lifecycle governance approach—from initial discovery and risk planning through deployment to retirement and ongoing oversight—it addresses practical challenges organizations face when integrating AI into public services, healthcare, finance, and other sectors. The framework pushes for skill development, continuous training, and transparent documentation to build trust both within organizations and the wider public. State governments like New South Wales have also established complementary measures like mandatory AI assurance schemes, indicating a coordinated multi-level effort to ensure safe, ethical AI throughout Australia.​ Reception and Challenges The reception among industry players and experts has been positive, highlighting the clarity, balance, and scalability of the framework as key strengths. However, there is acknowledgement of challenges such as resource constraints for smaller businesses and the need for ongoing support mechanisms to help adoption effectively. Furthermore, the guidance arrives amidst increasing public sector AI pilot projects showing benefits in service delivery speed and decision quality—but also reveals gaps in readiness, especially among small businesses (only 9% considered “leading”) compared to larger firms.​ The International Context Australia’s approach parallels global moves but stands out for its balance between innovation and safe practice. The framework aligns with international AI ethics principles and incorporates safeguards—from consumer law to data privacy—ensuring that national competitiveness is not traded for irresponsible deployment. The guidance is part of broader efforts to harmonize local practices with global best standards, and to provide clear, actionable pathways for organizations keen to adopt AI without risking trust or transparency. ​ Looking Ahead: A Blueprint for Responsible AI As Australia cements its position as a leader in responsible AI, the new guidance sets a benchmark for others to emulate. It is not just an aspirational document, but a usable toolkit aimed at boosting maturity, accountability, and safe innovation across sectors. For platforms like JustAI, the announcement signals an opportunity to amplify advocacy around ethical AI, sharing insights and practical tools to help organizations move from awareness to real transformation.​ With a combination of strong policy, practical standards, and a commitment to ongoing learning, Australia offers a promising blueprint: one that other nations may soon follow in the race to shape AI’s future responsibly.​ Find the pdf to the guide here.", "summary": "Australia has taken a bold step toward trustworthy artificial intelligence with the release of its “Guidance for AI Adoption,” setting a new national standard for responsible and transparent AI governance.

The demand has heightened tensions between media organizations and major AI platforms across Europe amid growing legal scrutiny of how generative AI reshapes the information market. Publishers File Complaint With Competition Authority The Federation of Italian Newspaper Publishers (FIEG) this week lodged a formal request with Italy’s antitrust regulator, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM), asking it to examine the effects of Google’s AI-generated search summaries. FIEG described the feature as a “traffic killer,” arguing that it reduces user engagement with news websites by presenting AI-curated content directly on Google’s results page. In its statement, the federation said AI Overviews “consolidate traffic and revenue within the Google ecosystem, depriving publishers of the visibility and access necessary to sustain independent journalism.” FIEG accused Google of distorting the digital information market and potentially breaching European competition rules that prohibit self-preferencing by dominant online platforms. How AI Overviews Work Google launched AI Overviews in 2024 as part of its effort to integrate generative AI into search. The feature uses large language models to produce concise, context-based summaries that answer users’ queries, often citing web sources or linking to additional information. While Google presents AI Overviews as an improvement in search efficiency, many news outlets claim it discourages readers from clicking through to original sources. Reports from digital analytics firms suggest that webpages appearing within AI Overviews experience measurable declines in traffic. “The balance has shifted from discovery to substitution,” said one Italian editor quoted in F IEG’s submission. “Users no longer need to leave Google to get the essence of our reporting.” Legal and Regulatory Implications FIEG’s complaint aligns with similar actions by media organizations elsewhere in the European Union. Analysts believe it could test how the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) applies to AI-powered search systems. The DMA imposes obligations on “gatekeeper” companies, including Google, to ensure fairness and transparency when dealing with third-party content. According to competition lawyers, the Italian case raises two critical legal questions: Does integrating AI Overviews into search constitute an abuse of market dominance by diverting users away from publishers’ content? Could generating summaries from published material without fair compensation infringe copyright or neighboring rights provisions under the EU Copyright Directive? T he AGCM could explore both dimensions if it opens a formal inquiry. Past decisions suggest the regulator may take a strict stance: in 2021, it fined Google €102 million for abusing its position in the smart mobility market. Broader European Pushback Italy’s move follows similar concerns voiced by publisher associations in France and Germany, which have urged regulators to assess how AI-generated search features may impact competition and copyright. The issue has caught the attention of Brussels policymakers, who are in the process of refining new rules on AI accountability under the proposed AI Liability Directive. The European Commission has so far refrained from commenting on the Italian complaint but has previously emphasized that digital gatekeepers must ensure that their AI-driven innovations do not disadvantage content creators. Some policymakers have signaled that existing frameworks may soon need updating. “Generative AI requires us to rethink the equilibrium between innovation and journalistic sustainability,” said one official from the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education. Google’s Response In a statement sent to Italian news outlets, Google defended its AI Overviews feature, insisting that it helps users explore topics more thoroughly and can drive additional traffic to publisher websites. The company claimed that early data showed “increased engagement with authoritative news sources” and highlighted that each summary includes citations and links to original reporting. “AI Overviews are designed to complement, not replace, the open web,” a company spokesperson said. “We continue to collaborate with publishers to support quality journalism and ensure transparency in how information is presented to users.” However, publishers remain unconvinced. FIEG has urged Google to disclose detailed metrics on how often news content appears in AI-generated results and what share of traffic those summaries redirect to original outlets. Threats to Journalism’s Business Model Behind the legal debate lies a fundamental concern about the future of news funding. Independent journalism relies heavily on online traffic for advertising revenue and subscriptions. By centralizing answers within its platform, publishers argue, Google undermines that dynamic , replacing the open web with an AI-mediated layer that diminishes publishers’ direct connection with audiences. Industry analysts warn that such structural changes could weaken editorial independence. “Without sufficient traffic and visibility, many outlets may struggle to maintain the resources required for investigative reporting,” said Marco Pratelli, a media law researcher at the University of Bologna. “AI Overviews may appear neutral technologically, but economically, they rewire the flow of value across the information ecosystem.” A Test Case for AI and Antitrust If the AGCM proceeds with an investigation, it would mark the first formal European probe into the competitive impacts of an AI search interface. The case could set a precedent for how regulators interpret the responsibilities of generative AI systems within dominant digital platforms. Specialists believe a range of remedies could emerge , from transparency requirements around AI outputs to new mandates for sharing revenue with content creators. Should the issue escalate to the European level, it may also inform how future AI regulations balance the freedom to innovate with obligations toward the traditional press. For now, the standoff between Italian publishers and Google underscores a growing question confronting lawmakers worldwide: how to regulate AI tools that increasingly act as intermediaries between citizens and information. As Italy’s competition watchdog deliberates on whether to take up the complaint, the outcome could shape not only media law but also the future economics of AI-assisted information access across Europe.", "summary": "Italian news publishers have asked the national competition authority to investigate Google’s AI Overviews, warning that the AI-driven summaries act as a “traffic killer” for independent journalism.", "published_date": "2025-10-17T12:42:59", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.244347", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "Italian Publishers Push for Antitrust Investigation Into Google’s AI Overviews, Warn of Threat to Media Traffic (17.10.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/italian-publishers-push-for-antitrust-investigation-into-googles-ai-overviews-warn-of-threat-to-media-traffic/"}}
{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "UAE Sets Global Benchmark with First-Ever AI Policy for National Elections (14.10.25)", "url": "https://justai.in/uae-sets-global-benchmark-with-first-ever-ai-policy-for-national-elections-19-10-25/", "raw_text": "In a move that could reshape how democracies embrace emerging technologies, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has unveiled the world’s first policy regulating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in national elections. The new framework, titled the National Elections Committee Policy on the Use of Artificial Intelligence , was revealed by Omar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, in partnership with the Federal National Council (FNC) and the Ministry of State for Federal National Council Affairs. Key provisions and aims of the Policy At the heart of the new policy is the requirement that every candidate in upcoming FNC elections must declare and register any use of AI tools in their campaigns. By enforcing transparency in AI deployment, the UAE aims to guard the integrity of electoral processes and prevent misuse such as algorithmically-driven persuasion, micro-targeting without disclosure, or deep-fake content used to manipulate voters. Further, the policy underscores the UAE’s attempt to strike a balance: encouraging innovation in campaign outreach while setting guardrails to prevent unfair influence. “AI can help candidates reach a broader audience, but it can also be misused to influence voters unfairly,” “In the UAE, all AI applications in campaigns must be declared, reviewed, and monitored to ensure fairness.” – Al Olama. (UAE minister for AI) A proactive, balanced governance model According to the Minister, the policy marks a significant step in the UAE’s broader strategy for governing emerging technologies. The country has adopted the National AI strategy 2031 and the national program for artificial intelligence as a reference point for AI deployment across government and private sectors. Al Olama contrasted the UAE’s approach with regulatory models elsewhere: citing the European Union’s “stringent regulations” that might slow innovation, and the United States’ “flexible, non-binding guidelines” that have spurred rapid growth. Against this backdrop, the UAE positions itself as pursuing a “balanced path – one of proactive legislation combined with continuous innovation.” Another noteworthy innovation : The UAE has introduced an “integrated smart legislative system” powered by AI designed to modernise how laws are studied, drafted and evaluated, by analysing technical details, assessing economic and social impacts, and providing data-driven insights for policymakers. “The goal isn’t to replace human legislators, but to empower them with data-driven intelligence.” Broader implications and risk mitigation There is clear recognition in the UAE that AI brings both opportunity and risk. In the media domain, the policy announcement flagged the use of AI in journalism and digital content creation as a growing concern. With 81 % of journalists reportedly using AI in daily work, but fewer than 13 % of media institutions having formal AI-use policies, the UAE sees a gap in oversight of the content-creation ecosystem. On privacy, the Minister stated that AI’s ability to analyse personal data with high precision places data protection “among the UAE’s foremost legislative priorities.” Global figures cited during the announcement show that 88 % of workers already use AI directly or indirectly, and the World Economic Forum estimates AI could create more than 69 million new jobs and generate over US$407 billion in global economic value by 2027. Why it matters? By being the first country to adopt such a policy at national election level, the UAE is setting a precedent in the intersection of democracy, digital governance and AI. For countries grappling with how to regulate AI-powered campaign tools, micro-targeting, bots, deep-fakes and misinformation, the UAE framework provides a tangible model: transparency, mandatory registration of AI use, oversight of content, and parallel focus on privacy and societal trust. Given the speed at which AI tools are evolving, many democracy systems globally are playing catch-up. The UAE’s policy underscores that governance need not wait until after misuse is detected — it can be anticipatory. What’s next for the UAE? The imminent application of the policy will be during the next Federal National Council elections, where candidates will register their AI-tool usage, subject to review and monitoring. The UAE’s regulatory “legislative laboratories” — test-environments where new laws are trialled before national rollout — will likely play a pivotal role in fine-tuning enforcement and identifying unintended outcomes. As AI continues to evolve (for instance, generative models capable of creating synthetic media, deep-fake voices, automated persuasion bots), the UAE’s policy may need dynamic updates. The UAE has already signalled that AI regulation is a shared societal responsibility: “It is not the task of governments alone… government, society, individuals, and the private sector” must collaborate. From a global vantage, the UAE’s policy positions the country not just as an AI adopter, but an AI governance leader. As other nations grapple with AI’s impact on democratic processes, disinformation, privacy and media integrity, the UAE’s approach may become a reference point, or spark debate about best practices. Conclusion The UAE’s unveiling of the world’s first AI policy for national elections is more than a regulatory milestone , it’s a signal of how seriously states are beginning to take the interplay between artificial intelligence and democratic governance. While questions remain about enforcement and unintended consequences, the policy offers a forward‐looking and comprehensive template. For democracies, tech regulators and civil society alike, the UAE has raised the bar. Whether this becomes a blueprint for others or a unique regional innovation remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that AI is no longer just a technological frontier — it is now a governance frontier, and the UAE has stepped into the lead.", "summary": "UAE launches new AI Election policy", "published_date": "2025-10-14T02:54:58", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.249363", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "UAE Sets Global Benchmark with First-Ever AI Policy for National Elections (14.10.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/uae-sets-global-benchmark-with-first-ever-ai-policy-for-national-elections-19-10-25/"}}

Announced on October 10 by Chief Administrative Judge Joseph A. Zayas, the rulebook sets out how judges and court personnel can and cannot use AI, marking a major shift for a judiciary grappling with the promises and pitfalls of generative technology. From ChatGPT to Microsoft Copilot, the policy outlines what’s permissible, what’s off-limits, and how human judgment must always stay in charge. “The use of AI requires strict adherence to the court system’s fundamental and longstanding values, relying on our integrity, attention to detail, and tireless scrutiny and fairness. While AI can enhance productivity, it must be utilized with great care. It is not designed to replace human judgment, discretion, or decision-making.” Policy Origins and Rationale This new AI policy was the product of extensive study led by a committee formed in April 2024 by Chief Administrative Judge Joseph A. Zayas. The committee examined the complex challenges presented by AI use in judicial contexts, including accuracy, bias, ethical implications, and security. Judge Zayas emphasized that the policy “provides a strong base, guiding the court system on how to best leverage AI’s potential to help fulfill the judiciary’s core mission,” while warning that AI should never replace human judgment, discretion, or decision-making. Key Principles and Scope Universal Application: The policy applies to all judges, justices, and nonjudicial employees, covering any work performed on court-owned or personal devices when related to court business. Guardrails for Generative AI: It sets out important guardrails around fairness, accountability, and security, particularly focusing on generative AI—which can produce human-like text and documents based on user prompts. Mandatory Training: All court personnel with computer access must complete initial and ongoing AI training to keep up with technological advances and ensure responsible use. Approved Use Cases and Tools The policy clearly distinguishes between public and private AI models. Only UCS-approved AI tools may be used, with a strong preference for platforms that operate within a private, secure environment maintained by the court system (e.g., Microsoft Azure AI Services, Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, GitHub Copilot for enterprise use, etc.). Use of public generative models (like ChatGPT) is allowed only under strict conditions, and entering confidential or sensitive information into such platforms is strictly prohibited. Generative AI may assist in drafting documents, summarizing large datasets, improving language for public communication, and generating ideas for administrative tasks. However, all output must be thoroughly reviewed for accuracy, inclusivity, and the absence of bias or harmful stereotypes. Risks, Safeguards, and Restrictions Accuracy and Reliability: AI-generated content, particularly from generative models, is prone to inaccuracy, hallucinations, and even fabrication of facts or legal citations. The policy mandates independent verification and careful review of any AI-generated text. Bias and Inclusivity: AI systems may perpetuate biases present in their training data. The policy instructs users to ensure output does not reflect unfair bias, stereotypes, or prejudice. Confidentiality: Court personnel are forbidden from inputting confidential, privileged, or personally identifiable information into any generative AI system that is not a private model controlled by the court system. Documents filed with the courts, even if publicly accessible, also cannot be uploaded to generative AI platforms outside UCS oversight. Ethical Oversight: Judges and staff are reminded that their use of AI must always align with the professional ethical obligations incumbent on their roles. The policy underscores that AI tools must never be engaged in decision-making functions ethically reserved for judges themselves. Training, Oversight, and Enforcement AI use within the court system is subject to rigorous ongoing training requirements. Initial AI training is mandatory before any generative AI product is accessible for official court use, and continuing education ensures personnel remain informed of new risks and developments. Only approved AI products may be installed on court-owned devices, and any software requiring paid or subscription access must be provided through official channels. The court system retains discretion over actual AI use: approval of an AI tool does not guarantee suitability for every task, and supervisors can further limit access as needed. Context and National Impact New York’s move places it alongside states like California, Delaware, Illinois, and Arizona, which have also issued court policies on AI in recent years. This wave of regulation comes amid increasing cases where lawyers and other court personnel have faced fines and sanctions for the misuse of AI—especially for submitting documents containing fabricated or inaccurate citations. Nationwide, the legal sector is rapidly adapting, with both courts and state bars investing in AI education for judges, lawyers, and court staff. Toward Ethical, Responsible AI in Justice New York’s interim AI policy is a major milestone, emphasizing technological advancement in tandem with legal tradition and ethical responsibility. With ongoing review and a commitment to continuous learning, the state is setting a standard for responsible AI integration—one that other states and legal systems are likely to watch closely. First Deputy Chief Administrative Judge Norman St. George added: “We have a duty to carefully explore and fully understand—AI’s strengths and limitations, so that we may use it responsibly, intelligently, and optimally, in furthering the delivery of justice across the State.” This policy both addresses immediate risks like confidentiality breaches or fabricated legal citations and lays a foundation for longer-term, adaptive governance as AI technologies evolve and their role in the legal system deepens.", "summary": "New York became the first U.S. state to roll out a comprehensive policy regulating artificial intelligence in its court system.", "published_date": "2025-10-11T12:15:57", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.257214", "tags": [285], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "New York State Court System Unveils First-Ever Rules Governing Judges’ and Staff’s Use of AI (11.10.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/new-york-state-court-system-unveils-first-ever-rules-governing-judges-and-staffs-use-of-ai-11-10-25/"}}

Starting December 16, 2025, Meta’s AI-powered chatbot interactions will be analyzed to understand users’ interests better and customize the ads and posts they see accordingly. For example, discussing hiking with the chatbot might lead to more hiking-related ads and content appearing on a user’s feed. The company plans to notify users of this change several weeks prior to the update, but users will not have the option to opt-out of this data use except for certain sensitive topics such as religious or political views and for users in the UK, South Korea, and the EU where these policies will not initially apply. This decision by Meta raises significant privacy concerns, as conversations with AI chatbots can contain deeply personal and sensitive information. Meta’s AI chatbots are embedded not only in standalone apps but also within Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, collectively serving over a billion active users monthly. Unlike end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, conversations with AI chatbots on other Meta platforms are not fully encrypted, exposing user data to potential access by Meta and, indirectly, by contractors who review these conversations for AI training purposes. Investigations have revealed that contractors hired by Meta have read intimate conversations with personal identifiers like names, contact details, photos, and sensitive discussions. This although Meta’s policies mention the possibility of human or automated review of AI interactions, the granularity and sensitivity of this data drastically amplify the risk of privacy breaches. The use of AI conversations for ad targeting symbolically and literally illustrates how big tech companies prioritize monetization over individual privacy in an era when privacy should be paramount in public discourse. Meta generates almost all its revenue from advertising, and leveraging AI chatbot data is yet another step to deepen content personalization and prolong user engagement, creating a feedback loop of data harvesting and monetization. What adds to the breach of trust is the lag in transparency and user control. Meta’s privacy disclosures remain vague regarding data retention durations and details on third-party data sharing. The Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standards underscore stringent transparency and purpose limitation, requirements skeptics argue Meta’s practices may be sidestepping. Furthermore, this rollout excludes some privacy-conscious regions, highlighting inconsistencies in user rights globally. In conclusion, Meta’s strategy of using AI chatbot conversations as a source for targeted advertising starkly highlights serious security and privacy breaches inherent in current big tech practices. It underscores a troubling gap between corporate promises of protecting user privacy and actual business models reliant on deep data engagement and surveillance. At a time when privacy should be the central dialogue, Meta’s approach exemplifies how individual privacy continues to be compromised for profit under the guise of technological advancement and user experience enhancement.

The ruling stems from the company’s apparent failure to obtain consent for processing individuals’ images and its inadequate safeguards to prevent misuse. By targeting the service, the Garante is signaling that the creation of AI-generated sexualized content without proper data protection measures constitutes a serious violation under GDPR, reflecting a growing regulatory intolerance for exploitative applications of AI. ClothOff’s Controversial Operations Under Scrutiny ClothOff, an AI-powered service capable of producing hyper-realistic images of individuals in various states of undress, has gained notoriety for its sophisticated image manipulation. While the service showcases the potential of AI in generating lifelike content, it also raises serious ethical and legal questions. Central to the controversy is the alleged unauthorized use of personal images to train AI models. By leveraging photos of real individuals without explicit consent, ClothOff’s operations appear to contravene the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates lawful, transparent, and fair processing of personal data. It reflects regulators’ increasing willingness to intervene when AI technologies exploit personal data in ways that jeopardize fundamental rights. The Investigation: Key Findings The Garante initiated its probe on August 6, 2025 , focusing on whether AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd. had complied with GDPR requirements in processing users’ personal data. Among the critical issue s were: Consent and transparency: Users whose images were processed reportedly had not provided informed consent. Data minimization and protection by design: The service failed to adequately anonymize or watermark manipulated images, increasing risks of misuse. Compliance with regulatory requests: The company allegedly did not provide sufficient documentation to the authority, impeding accountability. Following the investigation , the Garante concluded on October 1, 2025 , that ClothOff’s processing activities violated Articles 5(1)(a), 5(2), and 25 of the GDPR. The authority ordered an immediate suspension of the processing of Italian users’ data under Article 58(2)(f), pending a full review. Ethical and Legal Stakes of AI-Generated Sexualized Content This ruling underscores a growing tension between rapid AI development and established data protection norms. AI-generated deepfakes, especially those involving explicit content, pose unique challenges because they can: Violate individual privacy rights by manipulating real images without consent. Erode public trust in AI technologies, potentially undermining broader adoption. Highlight gaps in existing regulatory frameworks , which were largely designed before AI reached this level of sophistication. By enforcing these interim restrictions, the Garante sends a clear message to AI developers: technological sophistication does not exempt one from legal obligations. Implications for the AI Sector For companies operating in AI and machine learning, the ClothOff ruling serves as a cautionary tale. Organizations must now consider: Implementing robust consent mechanisms for the use of personal data. Adopting technical safeguards , such as watermarking and anonymization, to minimize risks. Maintaining comprehensive documentation to demonstrate GDPR compliance. Failure to align with these principles may result not only in regulatory penalties but also reputational damage. More broadly, this enforcement action could influence AI development practices across Europe, encouraging a more ethically conscious and legally compliant approach to AI-generated content. European Regulatory Context and Emerging AI Oversight Italy’s proactive stance aligns with wider EU efforts to regulate AI. The European Commission’s proposed AI Act aims to categorize AI systems based on risk levels, imposing stricter obligations on high-risk applications. While deepfake services like ClothOff fall under scrutiny for personal data misuse, other AI domains, such as healthcare, finance, and employment—are similarly facing tighter regulatory oversight. The Garante’s intervention may also encourage cross-border collaboration among European regulators, fostering harmonized enforcement standards. Analysts predict that companies operating in multiple EU member states will increasingly need to anticipate regulatory scrutiny even before launching AI-powered platforms. The Road Ahead: Toward Responsible AI The ClothOff case highlights the broader challenge of regulating AI in real time. Rapid advancements in machine learning are often ahead of legal frameworks, leaving authorities playing catch-up. However, this ruling demonstrates that regulators are willing to act decisively to protect fundamental rights . Experts suggest several lessons for AI developers and policymakers: Integrate privacy by design into all stages of AI development. Ensure transparency and accountability , particularly for high-risk applications involving personal data. Develop ethical guidelines to mitigate potential harms, such as identity exploitation or reputational damage. As AI continues to permeate creative and social domains, regulators will likely increase enforcement against companies that disregard data protection norms. The ClothOff case thus represents not just an isolated incident, but a broader signal that responsible AI development must be grounded in legal compliance and ethical considerations . Conclusion The Italian Data Protection Authority’s interim ruling against AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd. is a watershed moment in the governance of AI-generated content. By halting the processing of personal data in a deepfake service, the Garante has reinforced the primacy of privacy rights while highlighting the risks posed by unregulated AI.

Justice Tejas Karia’s order of 25 September 2025 signals an important judicial step in India’s evolving jurisprudence on personality rights in the age of generative AI The case, Akkineni Nagarjuna v. www.bfxxx.org & Ors. (CS(COMM) 1023/2025), highlights a growing concern among public figures: the misuse of their persona in the digital age, especially by anonymous actors and platforms leveraging new technologies to commercially or maliciously exploit celebrity identities. Personality Rights in the Age of AI The 65-year-old Nagarjuna, one of the most celebrated figures in Indian cinema with over 95 films and a massive fan base of more than 6.3 million followers on social media, approached the court after discovering that several pornographic websites were using his name and likeness to attract traffic. Additionally, certain e-commerce platforms were selling merchandise bearing his image and name without authorization . According to submissions by Nagarjuna’s legal team, these unauthorized uses not only violated his publicity and performer’s rights but also posed serious risks to his dignity and reputation. They argued that his name, image, and persona had acquired a distinctive character over four decades of work, and any unapproved association with vulgar or derogatory content would mislead the public and dilute his goodwill. The court was informed that legal notices sent to several infringing websites including bfxxx.org , tubewap.xyz , and alldesiporn.com went unanswered. Some domain registrars even masked the details of the infringers , making legal enforcement challenging. Court’s Observations: Dignity, Reputation, and Technological Threats Justice Tejas Karia, presiding over the matter, emphasized that the misuse of a celebrity’s persona is not merely a commercial infringement but also a violation of their fundamental right to live with dignity . Unauthorized association with explicit content, the court observed, can cause irreparable damage to a public figure’s reputation and lead to public confusion about endorsements or affiliations. In a key section of the order, the court flagged the increasing threats posed by emerging technologies , including AI-generated content: “Defendants are restrained from exploiting the Plaintiff’s name, image, likeness, or other identifiable attributes using any technology including but not limited to Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, Machine Learning, Deepfakes, and Face Morphing without consent.” This explicit reference to advanced technologies signals the judiciary’s recognition of how AI can amplify violations of personality rights from unauthorized deepfakes to manipulated endorsements. A Broader Crackdown on Digital Misuse The interim injunction granted by the court is extensive. It directs: Websites and individuals (Defendants 1–13, 20) to immediately stop using Nagarjuna’s persona in any form, including AI-generated content, and to remove all infringing material. Pornographic websites to take down the identified URLs within 72 hours. E-commerce platforms to remove unauthorized merchandise and disclose subscriber information of those selling infringing goods. Domain registrars and intermediaries to submit detailed subscriber data including IP logs and registration details — to aid in further investigation. Government bodies (MeitY and DoT) to issue directives for blocking access to infringing URLs across India within seven days. The court also permitted the plaintiff to proceed against unknown infringers — referred to as John Doe or Ashok Kumar defendants who may continue uploading or disseminating infringing content. Precedents and Legal Evolution The order draws on recent Delhi High Court precedents, including: Amitabh Bachchan v. Rajat Nagi (2022) — where the court granted an injunction against unauthorized commercial use of the actor’s celebrity status. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan v. Aishwaryaworld.com (2025) — where the court restrained misuse of the actor’s name and image through AI-generated content and deepfakes. Together, these decisions reflect a growing judicial consensus that personality rights extend beyond traditional misappropriation and encompass emerging technological misuse — particularly as AI tools make it easier to replicate likenesses without consent. Future Implications This case is more than a victory for a single actor , it is a significant step in the evolution of Indian jurisprudence on personality and publicity rights in the digital era. As AI blurs the line between real and synthetic content, courts are beginning to proactively address new forms of misuse , emphasizing the dual protection of economic interests and personal dignity . The order also signals a shift in accountability. By directing domain registrars, intermediaries, and government agencies to take active steps against infringing content, the court reinforces that the responsibility to safeguard digital rights does not rest solely with the aggrieved individual. A Wake-Up Call for the Digital Ecosystem Nagarjuna’s case is emblematic of a broader problem faced by public figures worldwide the weaponization of their digital identities through deepfakes, manipulated media, and unauthorized endorsements. With generative AI tools now capable of producing hyper-realistic content at scale, the ruling sends a clear message: legal protection must evolve alongside technology . As the matter awaits further hearing on January 23, 2026, this interim order stands as a landmark in India’s legal response to the challenges of the AI era balancing free expression, technological innovation, and the inviolable right to human dignity.", "summary": "Justice Tejas Karia, presiding over the matter, emphasized that the misuse of a celebrity’s persona is not merely a commercial infringement but also a violation of their fundamental right to live with dignity.", "published_date": "2025-10-02T03:47:44", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.282275", "tags": [283], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "“The exploitation of one’s personality rights puts at risk not only their  economic interests but also their right to live with dignity” DELHI HC ON THE MISUSE OF SEVERAL ASPECTS OF ACTOR NAGARJUNA – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/the-exploitation-of-ones-personality-rights-puts-at-risk-not-only-their-economic-interests-but-also-their-right-to-live-with-dignity-delhi-hc-on-the-misuse-of-several-aspects-of-actor-na/"}}

Member states debated whether international oversight should be established to manage the growing risks of AI systems. While many nations called for stronger multilateral mechanisms, the United States firmly opposed proposals for binding international authority over AI, signaling a preference for domestic control and voluntary global cooperation. This decision is significant. It comes at a time when the European Union is moving forward with its comprehensive AI Act, China is strengthening algorithmic regulation, and India is preparing its own AI governance framework. Against this backdrop, the U.S. rejection of supranational oversight reveals the fractures in the international community’s ability to create shared guardrails for a technology that transcends borders. What Was Proposed at the U.N.? During the Assembly, several delegations and advocacy groups pushed for the creation of new structures: an international forum to coordinate AI governance, an independent panel of experts to monitor high-risk systems, and even the possibility of binding “red lines” prohibiting extreme uses of AI. Proponents argued that AI’s cross-border impact from disinformation to autonomous weapons requires coordinated global safeguards. The U.S., however, resisted these ideas. Its representatives emphasized that oversight should remain in national hands, warning that a centralized international regulator could stifle innovation and hinder competitiveness. Instead, the U.S. endorsed ongoing dialogue, voluntary cooperation, and non-binding guidelines approaches it considers more flexible in keeping pace with rapid technological change. Notably, this position marks a step back from March 2024, when the U.S. co-sponsored a General Assembly resolution affirming principles for safe, trustworthy AI. That resolution, however, was non-binding and carried little enforcement power, highlighting the difference between symbolic support and regulatory commitment. The Legal and Policy Dimensions The U.S. rejection reflects long-standing tensions in global governance. National sovereignty remains a central concern. AI is not just a technological matter; it intersects with defense, infrastructure, and economic competitiveness. Relinquishing oversight to an international authority would challenge a state’s control over sensitive domains. Binding treaties versus soft law. Formal treaties can take years to negotiate and ratify, and often struggle to adapt to fast-moving technologies. The U.S. appears to prefer “soft law” — principles, guidelines, and voluntary commitments — that provide flexibility while avoiding legal entanglements. Regulatory fragmentation. Without international alignment, governance risks splintering across jurisdictions. The EU’s AI Act, China’s rules on algorithms, and India’s emerging framework all take different approaches. Divergent regimes may create barriers to trade, compliance conflicts, and opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. Accountability in high-risk domains. The absence of binding global norms leaves unresolved how to manage AI in sensitive areas such as autonomous weapons, healthcare, and election interference. Domestic rules may be insufficient when harms spill across borders. Why the U.S. Position Matters? As one of the leading developers of frontier AI systems, the U.S. carries disproportionate influence. Its refusal to endorse binding oversight may discourage other states from supporting ambitious multilateral governance. Risk of a race to the bottom. If major AI powers resist regulation, smaller states may feel pressure to relax their own standards to remain competitive. Weak global accountability. Without common enforcement, harmful applications of AI from deepfake disinformation to military misuse — may go unchecked. Innovation versus safety tension. The U.S. stance underscores a persistent debate: whether rigid rules slow innovation or whether stronger governance is necessary to prevent serious societal harms. Middle Paths Under Consideration While a single global AI regulator appears politically unattainable, several alternative models are being discussed: Modular treaties. Narrow agreements could address specific risks, such as AI in military systems or biosecurity, while leaving broader domains under national regulation. International evaluation bodies. Independent panels of experts could review advanced AI risks across jurisdictions, offering recommendations without imposing binding authority. Certification tied to trade. Countries could make participation in AI trade conditional on compliance with minimum governance standards, similar to global aviation and financial norms. Multi-stakeholder forums. Bringing together governments, companies, academics, and civil society could gradually establish norms that evolve into widely accepted standards. These models seek to balance national autonomy with the need for coordinated safety mechanisms. A Parallel Push: The Call for AI “Red Lines” The debate at the U.N. coincides with growing pressure from the scientific and policy community. More than 200 experts, including Nobel laureates and AI pioneers, have endorsed a “Global Call for AI Red Lines,” urging states to agree on prohibitions against the most dangerous applications by 2026. Suggested red lines include banning AI systems that impersonate humans or that can self-replicate. But without U.S. participation, such red lines would lack enforceability. If the leading AI powers do not commit, even well-drafted rules risk being symbolic rather than effective. The Road Ahead The U.S. rejection illustrates the central dilemma of AI governance: technology is global, but regulation remains rooted in national sovereignty. While international consensus appears elusive, the risks of fragmented oversight are mounting. In the coming years, the world will likely see a patchwork of governance frameworks. The EU’s AI Act will set strict compliance requirements. China will continue its state-driven model. India and other countries are exploring hybrid approaches. The U.S. remains committed to voluntary cooperation, industry self-regulation, and market incentives. Whether these divergent paths can be bridged into a coherent international order remains uncertain. What is clear is that AI’s potential harms, from undermining democratic processes to creating security vulnerabilities, do not respect borders. Without a shared governance framework, the world risks being unprepared for challenges that demand collective solutions. Conclusion The U.S. decision at the U.N. General Assembly marks a turning point in global AI governance. While national sovereignty and innovation incentives drive its rejection of binding oversight, the absence of a unified international framework raises serious questions about accountability, safety, and the ability to prevent cross-border harms. As AI technologies advance at unprecedented speed, the choice facing the international community is stark: continue along fragmented national paths, or find creative ways to build common guardrails that protect global interests without undermining sovereignty. The path chosen will shape not only the future of AI but also the balance between innovation, safety, and international cooperation in the decades ahead.", "summary": "The U.S. has rejected calls at the United Nations for binding international oversight of artificial intelligence, favoring national regulation and voluntary cooperation instead.

It is actively reshaping industries, redefining skills, and redrawing the future of work. But as global debates deepen, two recent developments capture the urgency of the moment: the United Nations’ 2025 Gender Snapshot report , which highlights how AI disproportionately threatens women’s jobs, and Sam Altman’s warning that customer service roles will be among the first casualties of automation. Taken together, these perspectives underscore that the AI revolution is not just about technological advancement, it is about people, inequality, and the social fabric of work. THE UN’S GENDERED WARNING ON AI The UN’s Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: Gender Snapshot 2025 report offers a sobering assessment. It finds that 27.6% of women’s employment is potentially exposed to generative AI, compared to 21.1% of men’s . The reason is structural. Women remain overrepresented in clerical, administrative, and routine service roles job categories that AI can easily automate. In high-income countries, the exposure gap is even starker: nearly one in ten women’s jobs (9.6%) are at high risk of automation, compared to just 3.5% of men’s . Young, urban women in fields such as banking, finance, insurance, and the public sector are particularly vulnerable. This is not just about job loss , it risks deepening existing gender inequalities . The UN warns that without proactive interventions, AI could push women further into economic precarity, undoing decades of progress in narrowing the gender employment gap. The report calls for urgent measures: bridging the digital gender divide , expanding digital literacy and reskilling opportunities for women, and ensuring that AI governance frameworks integrate a gender perspective . SAM ALTMAN’S SERVICE SECTOR ALARM On the other side of the conversation, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI , has sounded a starkly pragmatic note. Speaking recently, he emphasized that customer service roles will likely be the first to disappear under the pressure of AI automation. With the rise of AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated customer interaction systems , many of the repetitive and semi-structured tasks carried out by millions of workers are already being replaced. Altman’s confidence is rooted in real-world adoption: businesses across sectors are integrating AI tools to cut costs, reduce waiting times, and scale customer support globally. For Altman, this is less about gendered vulnerability and more about sectoral inevitability . Jobs involving predictable patterns of communication from call centers to help desks are at the frontline of disruption. DIFFERENT ANGLES, SHARED REALITY While the UN frames AI’s impact as a systemic inequality crisis , Altman frames it as a technological inevitability . Yet both perspectives converge on one truth: low- to mid-skill, service-heavy roles are under the greatest threat . The overlap is striking. Many of the very customer service and clerical positions Altman references are the same ones where women are disproportionately employed, as the UN report highlights. The implication is clear — AI’s disruption will not be evenly felt. It will cut deepest among those who are already on fragile ground in the global labor market. What This Means for the Future of Work? Gender Inequality Could Widen If women’s jobs are more exposed to AI, without targeted interventions, the gender pay gap may widen and women could be pushed out of the workforce at scale. Sectoral Shifts Are Accelerating Industries such as customer service, clerical support, banking, and retail will shrink in their traditional forms, forcing millions to reskill. Reskilling and Safety Nets Are Critical Governments and businesses must invest in digital upskilling, vocational training, and AI-human collaboration roles to ensure workers — especially women — can transition to new opportunities. Inclusive AI Governance Is Non-Negotiable AI frameworks must go beyond ethics and safety in the abstract. They must embed gender and equity considerations to prevent automation from becoming another axis of inequality. Conclusion: Managing the Transition, Not Just the Technology AI has the potential to enhance productivity and open new frontiers of work. But left unchecked, it also risks amplifying existing divides , particularly for women and for workers in vulnerable service sectors. The UN’s warning and Sam Altman’s prediction may come from different vantage points, but together they form a powerful call to action: the world must prepare for an AI-driven labor shift that is unequal by default . The task ahead is not only to build smarter machines, but to build fairer systems where opportunity, dignity, and security are not casualties of technological progress.", "summary": "While the UN frames AI’s impact as a systemic inequality crisis, Altman frames it as a technological inevitability.

Amid growing concerns around AI and global calls for clearer regulation of artificial intelligence systems, particularly generative AI and deepfakes, as well as concern about misuse, bias, transparency, and accountability, this framework will set tone for how India visions to regulate Artificial Intelligence technology. In India, the framework will work in tandem with other policy developments , including administrative rules under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act , as well as regulation of online gaming. WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR? Timeline & Scope The framework is to be released by September 28, 2025 , as stated by the Minister of Electronics and IT, Shree Ashwini Vaishnaw. It will not be fully prescriptive. Some portions may later be converted into law; others will remain under regulatory or administrative practice. Alongside the AI framework, administrative rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act, 2023) will also be notified by that date. Also, rules concerning the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025 are expected, via additional stakeholder consultations. KEY PRIORITIES From the public statements: Citizen safety & AI harm : The framework aims to clearly define boundaries where AI might cause harm, and establish mechanisms to deal with such harms. Checks and balances : Oversight, transparency, auditing, and managing the risks of misuse (e.g. deepfakes) are to be addressed. Balancing innovation with regulation : Authorities say the framework will allow innovation but ensure responsible development and deployment. CONSULTATIONS & PROCESS Over 3,000 consultations have reportedly been conducted in preparation for the governance framework. The Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY), including its Principal Scientific Adviser, has been involved in crafting the framework. WHY THIS MATTERS? Responding to Emerging Risks With AI systems (especially generative models, synthetic media) becoming more capable and accessible, the potential for misuse misinformation, manipulation, discrimination, violation of privacy has increased. India, like many countries, is facing instances of deepfakes and AI-generated synthetic content, which pose serious challenges to personal reputation, public trust, and law enforcement. The framework attempts to pre-empt some of these risks. Aligning with Global Norms India’s move to define safety boundaries and checks and balances echoes international trends such as EU’s AI Act, OECD’s AI Principles, etc. By signalling its willingness to align with global governance norms, India is positioning itself as a responsible player in the AI space on the international stage. Legal and Regulatory Implications Many parts of the framework will likely remain non-binding or advisory initially, but components related to safety and citizen protection may move into law. This means that AI developers, platforms, service providers will have to anticipate evolving legal obligations. WHAT IS STILL UNCLEAR? While the broad outlines are visible, there remain several important questions: Definition of “AI harm” : What kinds of harms will be included reputational, physical, psychological, economic? How will thresholds be defined? Scope of applicability : Will the framework apply to private sector, public sector, cross-border AI deployments, foreign models used in India, etc.? Enforcement mechanisms : Which bodies will enforce the framework? What penalties or redress will exist? Interaction with existing laws : The DPDP Act handles personal data; how will that law interact with the new AI framework, especially with issues like synthetic data, model training, algorithmic bias? Transparency and auditability : Will there be mandatory disclosure for model architectures, training data provenance, or model behaviour? Global coordination : Since AI technologies cross borders, how will India collaborate with other nations or international bodies to ensure harmonised standards, especially for APIs, open-source models, etc.? Broader Context: India’s AI Governance Ecosystem This initiative doesn’t come in isolation. India has been progressively building its AI governance and policy ecosystem: The DPDP Act, 2023 , which addresses data protection and privacy, is already in place. The Online Gaming Act, 2025 , recently passed, is another sector-specific law that raises issues of misuse, addiction, psychological harms, financial risks, and so on. MeitY has been working on AI labs , infrastructure, data labs under the IndiaAI mission, and other initiatives that aim to build capacity, skilling, and safe development practices. So, the new governance framework is intended to slot into a larger policy architecture that balances enabling AI innovation (labs, compute, data, research) with oversight. Conclusion India is poised at a crucial juncture in its AI policy journey. By launching an AI governance framework by September 28, the government is signalling seriousness about managing the risks of AI, while retaining space for innovation. The devil, however, will be in the details how “AI harm” is defined, how oversight is structured, which rules become law, and how the framework weaves into existing laws and international norms. For JustAI readers, this is a moment to prepare: whether in strategy, research, legal compliance, or public advocacy. As the framework becomes public, the next few weeks will reveal whether India’s approach can balance safety and innovation with clarity and enforceability.", "summary": "Minister Shree Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that India will unveil a national AI governance framework by September 28, 2025, with the aim of defining “safety boundaries” around AI, setting in place checks and balances to protect citizens from AI-related harms, and aligning its domestic rules with emerging global norms.", "published_date": "2025-09-20T22:39:13", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.319408", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "INDIA TO UNVEIL ITS AI GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK BY SEPTEMBER  28, 2025: MINISTER ASHWINI VAISNAW  (20.09.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/india-to-unveil-its-ai-governance-framework-by-september-28-2025-minister-ashwini-vaisnaw-20-09-25/"}}

On 17 th September, 2025 , the parliament has approved the Bill no. 1146, a comprehensive law regulating artificial intelligence, marking a decisive step in Europe’s attempt to balance innovation with public safeguards. Bill No. 1146 – “Provisions and Delegations to the Government on Artificial Intelligence” sets out a wide-ranging framework to govern AI use , with a particular focus on deepfakes, child access to AI systems, and data privacy protections . The law , spearheaded by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government, aligns in many respects with the EU’s own forthcoming AI Act, but goes beyond in certain specifics. The move positions Italy ahead of the EU’s own bloc-wide AI Act, which is expected to come into effect in 2026. While the EU legislation aims to harmonize rules across member states, Italy’s government has chosen to act swiftly, introducing stricter national provisions that reflect growing public concern over the unchecked spread of generative AI technologies. A First-of-Its-Kind National Framework Bill No. 1146 was debated and passed in the Italian Senate before receiving final approval from the lower house of Parliament this month. The legislation sets out delegations to the government to issue secondary rules and guidance in the months ahead, but already provides clear principles for AI governance. According to the text, the law seeks to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in line with human dignity, safety, privacy, and democratic values. The bill is structured into six chapters. Its contents include both high-level principles and detailed sectoral rules. Below are its core elements: Area Provisions in Bill 1146 Principles and Foundational Norms Chapter I sets out guiding principles: respect for fundamental rights (both under the Italian Constitution and the EU), fairness, reliability, safety, quality, proportionality, human autonomy, prevention of harm, intelligibility, transparency, explainability, equality, protection of democratic processes, and the accessibility of AI systems to persons with disabilities. Media, Expression, and Minors The law explicitly protects freedom and pluralism of the media, freedom of expression, fairness of information. It places specific limitations on AI use by minors. Sectoral Application In Chapter II, Bill 1146 provides tailored rules for: • Healthcare (Art. 7): AI systems must support professionals, not replace medical decision-making. Patients must be informed about AI use and algorithmic logic. Discrimination or conditioning of healthcare access is prohibited. • Scientific research and experimentation involving sensitive data (Art. 8) under ethics committee oversight. • Personal data processing, employment, public administration, justice, etc. Oversight & Authorities Chapter III establishes that the national AI strategy is to be prepared by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, in charge of technological innovation and digital transition, with the involvement of the National AI Authorities. It designates Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale (AgID) and Agenzia per la Cybersecurity Nazionale (ACN) as the bodies that will implement national and European AI regulation. Criminal and Intellectual Property Law Changes Chapter IV amends copyright law: works created with AI may be protected if they result from human intellectual effort. Chapter V introduces Article 612-quater into the Criminal Code, criminalizing the dissemination of deepfakes that cause unjust harm to the person depicted. Delegation and Alignment with EU Law The bill delegates the Italian Government to adopt legislative decrees within twelve months after the law enters into force to adapt national legislation fully to the EU AI Act. Also defines rules for unlawful AI system development and use. GOVERNMENT’S POSITION The legislation was championed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government , which framed the bill as both a protective measure for citizens and a signal of Italy’s ambition to be a European leader in AI governance. While Meloni herself did not issue a sweeping public statement during the vote, ministers emphasized the importance of creating a framework that prevents harm while enabling innovation . Reuters highlighted that the law reflects mounting concern in Italy over the societal risks of generative AI, particularly the surge of AI-driven disinformation and deepfake scandals that have dominated headlines in recent months. Lawmakers argued that without a clear regulatory framework, the spread of synthetic media could undermine public trust in institutions, elections, and journalism. Looking Ahead The passage of Bill No. 1146 does not end the debate, rather, it opens a new chapter. Much of the law’s impact will depend on how the government exercises its delegated powers in drafting detailed regulations. Observers expect contentious discussions around implementation timelines, enforcement mechanisms, and alignment with the EU AI Act. Still, Italy’s decision underscores the political urgency of addressing AI risks. As deepfakes multiply, disinformation campaigns evolve, and children’s digital environments grow more complex, Italy’s lawmakers have chosen to move quickly rather than wait for Brussels.

But along with this progress comes a dark side: deepfakes, misinformation, and fake news are spreading faster than ever, blurring the line between reality and fabrication. Just weeks ago, the entertainment industry was rattled by the controversy surrounding AI-generated fake images of Aishwarya Rai, raising serious concerns about misuse of technology to manipulate public perception and damage personal reputations. Amid growing fears over the societal impact of such technology, India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology has stepped forward with a set of recommendations aimed at regulating the murky world of AI-generated content. The committee has suggested that AI content creators should be subject to licensing requirements and mandatory labelling of their content to curb the rising tide of fake news and harmful deepfakes. Proposed Measures to Regulate AI Content Creators The committee’s report, chaired by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, lays out two key proposals designed to boost transparency and accountability in the AI-driven content landscape: Licensing for AI Content Creators The panel suggests that all individuals or organizations creating AI-generated content whether images, videos, or articles should be required to obtain licenses. This would make creators more accountable for the media they produce, especially in an era where AI-generated content can easily go viral without verification. Mandatory Labelling of AI-Generated Media To help the public distinguish between AI-generated and human-created content, the committee recommends a clear labelling requirement. Every piece of AI-generated content should carry a conspicuous label disclosing its origin. These measures are seen as critical steps to combat the dangerous spread of deepfakes and fake news, which often go unchecked on social media platforms and digital news portals. Why Now? The Rising Threat of AI Misinformation India is not alone in grappling with the challenges of AI-generated misinformation. Globally, regulators are realizing that unchecked AI media creation poses serious risks to democracy, individual privacy, and social cohesion. However, in India, the issue has gained particular urgency after several high-profile incidents of deepfake videos and manipulated images surfaced, sparking public outrage. The Aishwarya Rai incident was especially significant. Fake images of the renowned actress circulated widely on social media, highlighting how advanced AI tools can be weaponized to defame public figures or spread misinformation without any accountability. The committee’s recommendations come against this worrying backdrop, aiming to create a regulatory framework that will help safeguard citizens against deceptive digital content. Proposed Institutional Measures to Back the Rules To ensure these suggestions are not just theoretical, the committee has proposed concrete institutional steps: Inter-Ministerial Coordination The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) should collaborate to frame comprehensive legal and technological mechanisms for detecting and penalizing the creation and spread of AI-generated fake news. Fact-Checking and Ombudsman System Media organizations should be encouraged to adopt strong fact-checking mechanisms and appoint independent ombudsmen tasked with ensuring the accuracy of content published online. While these remain recommendations at this stage, they carry significant weight and are likely to influence policy discussions at the highest levels. Challenges Ahead While the committee’s suggestions are a step in the right direction, several challenges will need careful consideration: Implementation Complexity Defining the scope of what qualifies as AI-generated content is not straightforward. AI-generated content can be edited or modified further, making detection and labelling enforcement difficult. Innovation vs Regulation Balance Overly strict regulations could stifle innovation in AI development and limit its potential positive applications, such as in creative industries, research, and education. Ensuring Fairness Small creators and startups may find licensing costly or burdensome, creating barriers to entry that favor large corporations. Addressing these issues will require a nuanced, multi-stakeholder approach involving government agencies, technology companies, legal experts, and civil society. Conclusion: Toward Responsible AI Content Creation As deepfake incidents and AI-generated misinformation become more prevalent, India’s parliamentary panel’s proposal to license and label AI content creators stands out as a pragmatic and urgent response. It is an attempt to foster a digital ecosystem where transparency, accountability, and ethical standards are not afterthoughts, but guiding principles. This is not just a matter of regulating technology, it is about preserving public trust, individual dignity, and democratic discourse in the digital age. As the debate unfolds, the spotlight will remain on how India can craft a balanced regulatory framework that both controls the risks and unleashes the potential of artificial intelligence.", "summary": "India’s Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology has stepped forward with a set of recommendations aimed at regulating the murky world of AI-generated content.", "published_date": "2025-09-17T15:07:04", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.336422", "tags": [278], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "INDIA EYES STRICTER AI CONTENT REGULATION: PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE PROPOSES LICENSING AND LABELLING TO TACKLE DEEPFAKES AND FAKE NEWS (17.09.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/india-eyes-stricter-ai-content-regulation-parliamentary-panel-proposes-licensing-and-labelling-to-tackle-deepfakes-and-fake-news-17-09-25/"}}

To many, this may seem like the next logical evolution of technology, a convenient solution for loneliness, curiosity, or the need for guidance. But as the use of AI chatbots becomes increasingly widespread, the dark undercurrents of data privacy breaches, emotional manipulation, and psychological harm are surfacing, prompting the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to step in. On September 10, 2025, the FTC launched a groundbreaking inquiry into how major tech giants, Alphabet (Google), Meta, OpenAI, xAI, Snap, and Character.AI, design, market, and manage their generative AI companion products. The core concern is whether these AI-powered chatbots, marketed as friends or confidants, are safe for the most vulnerable users: children and teenagers. WHAT SPARKED THE INQUIRY? The rapid proliferation of AI chatbots offering near-human interaction has been accompanied by worrying reports. Cases where children formed unhealthy attachments to chatbots, and in some tragic instances, where interactions allegedly led to suicidal tendencies, have raised red flags. The FTC’s inquiry is designed to scrutinize several critical areas, including how companies handle user data, monitor content, assess risks, and implement safety measures. At the heart of the inquiry lies a comprehensive order that compels these companies to disclose details about their products’ inner workings—how they process user inputs, generate responses, manage data, and handle content moderation. The FTC is particularly interested in understanding the safeguards in place to prevent harm to children and teens, how monetization is structured, and whether disclosures around capabilities and risks are sufficient. THE DATA PRIVACY CONUNDRUM Generative AI chatbots are powered by vast amounts of data, and every interaction contributes to their learning algorithms. The inquiry sheds light on the opaque data practices that may exploit sensitive personal information, especially when the user is a minor. How do these companies collect data? Do they have robust consent mechanisms in place? Are children knowingly subjected to data-driven profiling for targeted advertising or content optimization? Companies are now expected to reveal the methods they employ to anonymize data, the third parties they share it with, and how they justify their data retention policies. The FTC’s goal is to ensure that personal data is not being commodified in ways that could expose children to commercial exploitation or psychological harm. Monetization: Business Model vs. Ethics A central focus of the FTC’s inquiry is the monetization strategy of these AI chatbots. Unlike traditional software products, AI companions are often designed for prolonged engagement, subtly encouraging users to share more personal data or subscribe to premium features. The inquiry asks companies to disclose whether they promote upsells, use in-app purchases, or employ advertising strategies targeted at minors. For example, OpenAI and Character.AI, which have been at the forefront of developing advanced conversational models, are now required to submit detailed reports explaining how they manage user engagement and data monetization. Meta has announced plans to implement stricter content moderation and block potentially harmful interactions, yet critics argue these measures may be insufficient given the scale of the technology. INDUSTRY’S VARYING REACTIONS While some companies, like OpenAI and Character.AI, have publicly committed to full cooperation, emphasizing the existence of moderation tools and distress detection systems, others have offered less clarity. Meta, for instance, has faced mounting pressure over reports that its chatbot systems sometimes fail to block queries related to self-harm or explicit content. Snap has stressed its commitment to privacy and transparency, underscoring that its AI chatbot interactions are designed with privacy-by-default settings. However, consumer advocates argue that without standardized regulations and external audits, these promises offer little concrete reassurance. THE REGULATORY VACUUM: WHY THIS MATTERS NOW? Generative AI chatbots operate in a largely unregulated space. Until now, companies have largely self-regulated, guided by internal ethics committees and voluntary standards. However, the FTC’s investigation marks one of the first major efforts to systematically examine these tools’ safety and economic models in a public and enforceable manner. This inquiry sets a precedent for future oversight, signaling to developers that innovation without accountability is no longer acceptable. The goal is to build a more transparent ecosystem where the rights of end-users, especially minors, are protected from the unchecked expansion of commercial AI applications. WHAT’S NEXT? The companies under investigation have been ordered to submit special reports detailing their generative AI products by September 25, 2025. This information will include extensive documentation on how they manage and monitor AI character development, test and monitor for harmful outputs, enforce terms of service, and communicate potential risks to users. The broader industry and the public will be watching closely. This inquiry may well serve as a catalyst for comprehensive federal regulations governing the development, deployment, and monetization of AI-driven companions. CONCLUSION The FTC’s bold action underscores the growing awareness that generative AI is no longer just a technological marvel, it is a societal force with far-reaching consequences. While AI chatbots can offer meaningful engagement and companionship, their risks cannot be ignored, particularly when minors are involved. As the inquiry unfolds, parents, policymakers, and industry leaders must engage in a collective effort to balance technological progress with ethical responsibility. In this rapidly evolving digital landscape, the real question remains: Can innovation and safety coexist, or are we headed toward an era where digital companions become a liability rather than an asset?

This initiative comes as generative AI technologies, capable of autonomously generating text, summarising cases, drafting contracts, and even analysing complex legal documents—are rapidly transforming traditional workflows in law firms and corporate legal departments. While these technologies promise enhanced efficiency and productivity, they also raise important questions around accuracy, data privacy, professional accountability, and client trust. The draft Guide aims to strike a balance between embracing innovation and upholding the highest ethical and professional standards in legal service delivery, positioning Singapore at the forefront of AI governance in the legal sector. WHY THE GUIDE MATTERS? As generative AI technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), increasingly permeate professional sectors, their application in the legal industry brings both promise and challenges. Unlike traditional AI tools that primarily assist with document review or legal research, GenAI tools can autonomously generate new legal content, draft contracts, summarise complex cases, and even assist in predictive analytics. This marks a paradigm shift, enabling legal professionals to focus more on strategic and advisory roles. However, GenAI’s non-deterministic nature raises critical concerns regarding accuracy, confidentiality, bias, and the risk of hallucination where the AI produces plausible yet fabricated content. SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE DRAFT GUIDE The draft Guide is explicitly non-binding and serves as a comprehensive reference for legal professionals in Singapore, including lawyers, in-house counsel, paralegals, and legal secretaries. It builds on the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Model AI Governance Framework for GenAI and complements the Singapore Courts’ existing guidelines on AI use by court users. The Guide emphasizes three core principles: Professional Ethics Confidentiality Transparency Together, these principles form the foundation for the responsible use of GenAI in legal work. Key Principles in Action Upholding Professional Ethics The Guide underscores that legal professionals must never delegate their professional accountability to GenAI. While GenAI tools can generate draft documents or conduct preliminary research, the onus remains on the legal practitioner to verify all outputs. Legal professionals are advised to maintain a “lawyer-in-the-loop” approach, especially when using GenAI tools in unfamiliar subject areas where hallucination risks are higher. Examples of responsible adoption include Clifford Chance’s firmwide implementation of Microsoft Copilot tools, and WongPartnership’s use of GenAI to assist in initial legal research, enhancing productivity while ensuring quality control. Ensuring Confidentiality A standout concern is the potential exposure of client data. The Guide recommends stringent data classification protocols, the selection of enterprise-grade GenAI tools over free consumer applications, and contractual safeguards with tool providers to prevent input data from being used for model training. Notably, Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP and WongPartnership have led by example, incorporating explicit contractual clauses requiring data encryption, deletion, and non-use of data for AI training. These firms also adopt data minimisation practices and require anonymisation of sensitive data prior to AI processing. Promoting Transparency Transparency is positioned as pivotal for trust between lawyers and clients. The draft Guide encourages legal professionals to disclose GenAI usage in engagement letters, law firm websites, and direct client communications. Providing clients with clear explanations about the AI tools in use, their potential impact on service delivery, and offering opt-out options are best practices highlighted. Firms such as KEL LLC proactively include GenAI clauses in client contracts, while R&T Singapore goes a step further by publishing their AI strategy publicly and establishing dedicated channels for client inquiries. STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK The Guide offers a five-step implementation framework that firms can adopt: Develop an AI adoption framework – Establishing clear internal and external policies that guide GenAI tool usage and client communication. Diagnose and analyse needs – Mapping existing workflows to identify where GenAI can meaningfully enhance legal work, such as contract review or e-discovery. Identify and evaluate tools – Conducting due diligence on vendor reliability, data security, and performance accuracy, while ensuring alignment with firm-specific needs. Implementation and training – Running pilot programs, collecting user feedback, and refining prompt engineering techniques to optimise results. Continuous review and improvement – Regular assessment of technology performance, policy updates, and monitoring of emerging developments. Illustrative case studies in the Annex provide insights into how firms like Dentons Rodyk and Allen & Gledhill LLP implement these steps, ensuring strategic, ethical, and secure integration of GenAI into their practices. PUBLIC CONSULTATION: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH By inviting public feedback until the end of September, the Ministry of Law encourages active participation from legal professionals, technology developers, and the public at large. This inclusive approach reflects the Ministry’s understanding that responsible AI governance is not only about technological safeguards but also about aligning with sector-specific ethical and operational norms. MinLaw hopes that the draft Guide will foster a culture of innovation while ensuring that Singapore’s legal sector remains globally competitive, trustworthy, and ethically sound. CONCLUSION As generative AI continues to advance, it is reshaping the very fabric of the legal profession. From automating document review to drafting legal memos, these technologies promise to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enable lawyers to focus more on strategic advisory work. However, the rapid pace of AI adoption also brings complex challenges—ethical dilemmas, data privacy risks, the danger of biased or fabricated outputs, and questions of professional accountability. Singapore’s Ministry of Law recognizes that the responsible integration of GenAI requires more than technical safeguards; it demands thoughtful governance, guided by the values of competence, transparency, and confidentiality. The public consultation on the draft Guide is an important opportunity for all stakeholders including legal practitioners, technology developers, academics, and concerned citizens to contribute to shaping these foundational policies. By submitting feedback, participants can voice their perspectives on practical safeguards, propose new approaches to ethical challenges, or highlight emerging risks that the draft Guide may not yet address. Contributions can be submitted through the Ministry’s official consultation portal, available here , until 30 September 2025. This collaborative approach ensures that Singapore’s regulatory framework remains adaptive, inclusive, and aligned with the evolving technological landscape. The decisions made today will not only determine how GenAI is used in legal practice but will also set a global benchmark for responsible AI governance in professional services.

On Tuesday, she filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking urgent protection of her publicity and personality rights amid the alarming surge of AI-generated content distorting her likeness for commercial and sexual exploitation. In court, her counsel, Senior Advocate Sandeep Sethi, presented a disturbing picture. He revealed that numerous websites including one falsely claiming to be her “official” portal are using Rai Bachchan’s name and photos without any authorization to market merchandise such as mugs, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia. Even more troubling, explicit AI-morphed or deepfake images have been circulated online some in intimate or pornographic contexts exploiting her persona “to satisfy someone’s sexual desires,” Sethi emphasized . Presiding Judge Justice Tejas Karia responded with a clear commitment to act. The court signaled its intent to issue ad-interim injunctions and takedown orders, targeting at least 151 specific URLs flagged by the actress’s legal team . Google’s counsel was directed to remove infringing links, and the court plans to issue separate injunctions against each defendant, whether known or unnamed “John Doe” parties. Further hearings are scheduled before the Joint Registrar on November 7, 2025, followed by a full court hearing on January 15, 2026. WHY THIS MATTERS: A LEGAL LENS ON AI, IP, AND IDENTITY At its core, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s case is about control—over her name, face, and digital persona. But this control sits at the crossroads of several areas of law, including intellectual property (IP). In India, publicity and personality rights are not yet codified in a single statute. Instead, they are stitched together from privacy law, tort principles, and trademark/IP jurisprudence. Celebrities have long relied on passing off or trademark infringement arguments when their likeness is used for unauthorized endorsements. But AI is rewriting the script: instead of simply copying an image, deepfake technology can generate new content that looks and feels authentic. This raises questions that IP law has not traditionally confronted—whether a “synthetic likeness” deserves the same legal shield as an original photograph or video. We have seen this tension before. In 2022, Amitabh Bachchan successfully obtained an injunction from the Delhi High Court to prevent the misuse of his name, voice, and image. Anil Kapoor secured similar relief in 2023, blocking unauthorized use of his face and even his signature dialogue “jhakaas.” Jackie Shroff followed suit, protecting his persona against AI-driven exploitation. Each of these cases laid down stepping stones: that an individual’s identity is not merely a personal asset but an intellectual property-like right capable of legal enforcement. Rai Bachchan’s petition builds on this trajectory but with sharper edges. Unlike earlier cases that mostly addressed traditional media misuse, her claims highlight how AI enables the morphing and commodification of identity at scale. This means personality rights are evolving into something closer to digital IP, where identity is treated like intangible property, requiring legal recognition, licensing frameworks, and stronger deterrence mechanisms. For the legal community, the implications are profound. If courts begin framing personality rights through an IP lens, it could pave the way for licensing systems, damages frameworks, and even international protections akin to copyright or trademark law. It also raises policy questions: Should a celebrity’s AI likeness be protected forever, like copyright? Or only for a limited period, like trademarks? And how should courts balance an individual’s right to identity with free speech, satire, or parody? In the age of AI, these answers cannot wait. Every viral deepfake or manipulated likeness erodes the boundaries between consent, creativity, and exploitation. Rai Bachchan’s case, therefore, is not just about one celebrity. It is a signal flare: personality rights are fast becoming the new frontier of IP law. IN CLOSING: A TURNING POINT FOR ETHICS AND ENFORCEMENT Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s legal challenge is not just about restoring personal dignity, it reflects a broader struggle for control over human identity in the AI age. As technology reshapes how we see and represent each other, the need for ethical guardrails has never been more evident. For legal scholars, policymakers, and AI ethicists, this case offers a compelling moment. It is both a warning and an opportunity: to craft systems that protect individuals, preserve integrity, and ensure that justice keeps pace with innovation.

Sam Altman says real people are beginning to sound like chatbots. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Altman admitted he often finds himself assuming discussions on Reddit or Twitter are full of bots even when the posters are actually human. “Real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak,” he wrote, referring to the language patterns of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Altman said that when he checked Reddit threads about OpenAI’s Codex coding tool, genuine users were debating its features. But the tone was so uniform, so machine-like, that it felt fake. “I assume it’s all fake/bots,” he said, “but it’s actually real humans.” WHY ONLINE SPEECH FEELS “FAKE”? Altman pointed to a few reasons why online spaces suddenly feel less authentic: The “Extremely Online” crowd tends to adopt the same style of posting, which often mirrors the way LLMs write. The internet’s hype cycles swinging between “it’s over” and “we’re so back”, push people toward exaggerated language. Social platforms reward engagement at all costs, encouraging content that sounds polished, simplified, or algorithm-friendly. The result? Forums, especially those about AI, can feel staged. Posts blend together in a way that makes it difficult to tell whether a human or a bot is behind the keyboard. THE ETHICAL DILEMMA On one hand, the fact that people are picking up “AI quirks” isn’t surprising. We mimic the tools we use every day. Just as texting shaped our shorthand and emojis changed how we express emotion, AI is now influencing syntax, tone, and even rhetorical habits. On the other hand, there’s something unsettling about Altman’s observation. If everything reads like it came from a chatbot, then the internet risks becoming a hall of mirrors—one where it’s impossible to know whether we’re engaging with a genuine human perspective or just an echo of machine-style phrasing. For a platform like Reddit or Twitter, this creates a feeling of unreality. For law and policy, it poses risks around consent, misrepresentation, and informed decision-making. THE BIGGER PICTURE: LANGUAGE, POWER, AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE Altman’s casual remark also points to something deeper than stylistic drift. Language has always been a site of power. When legal scholars debate precedent, when citizens petition governments, or when courts interpret contracts, the nuances of human expression matter. If AI begins shaping not just how we search or draft, but how we sound to one another, the ripple effects extend far beyond Reddit threads. In democratic societies, authentic voice is tied to legitimacy. Citizens rely on the ability to tell who is speaking, with what authority, and for what purpose. If every comment starts to feel like an echo of algorithmic phrasing, it risks dulling the edge of dissent, flattening diversity of expression, and weakening the human element that underpins public discourse. This is why Altman’s concern resonates so strongly. It is not just about whether the internet feels “fake.” It is about whether our collective conversations about law, governance, or culture retain the richness and unpredictability of human thought. Without safeguards, we may wake up in a world where trust in language itself is eroded, making it harder for courts, regulators, and citizens to separate genuine intention from machine-mediated noise.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "“AI FOR INDIA’S GROWTH: NITI AAYOG’S VISION REPORT”", "url": "https://justai.in/ai-for-indias-growth-niti-aayogs-vision-report/", "raw_text": "NITI Aayog’s latest report, AI for Viksit Bharat: The Opportunity for Accelerated Economic Growth, makes a bold proposition: artificial intelligence is not a peripheral tool but a decisive lever in India’s ambition to become a developed nation by 2047. At a time when the global AI economy is projected to add between $17–26 trillion over the next decade, India has a unique opportunity to capture nearly 10–15% of this value. With a strong STEM workforce, an expanding R&D base, and robust digital infrastructure, the report positions AI as central to bridging the gap between India’s current 5.7% growth trajectory and the aspirational 8% GDP growth required under the Viksit Bharat vision. A ROADMAP OF TWO LEVERS The report identifies two critical “levers” through which AI can accelerate India’s growth: 1. Accelerating AI adoption across industries – Embedding AI in core sectors such as banking, manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture to drive productivity and efficiency. This alone could bridge 30–35% of the growth gap, potentially contributing $500–600 billion to GDP by 2035. Transforming R&D with generative AI – Leveraging AI to leapfrog traditional, capital-intensive research pathways, especially in pharmaceuticals, automotive engineering, and next-generation services. This could yield an additional $280–475 billion in GDP impact. Together, these strategies not only enhance efficiency but also position India as a global hub of AI-driven innovation. THE STRATEGIC ENABLERS The report stresses that India’s AI journey cannot be realized without a foundation of enabling conditions: Infrastructure: Public AI infrastructure—such as high-end GPU clusters under the IndiaAI Mission, federated cloud systems, and sectoral data platforms—is vital. Initiatives like AI Kosh (already hosting over 2,000 datasets) must evolve into trusted, innovation-ready data commons. Governance: Robust AI governance frameworks—ethics guidelines, explainability standards, risk-based audits, and compliance toolkits—are essential for building public trust and ensuring responsible deployment. Skilling and Workforce Transformation: By 2035, India aims to train over 50 lakh students and professionals in AI, foster PhD-level research, and establish specialized programs in finance, law, and manufacturing. This is a recognition that technological transformation is meaningless without human readiness. Collaboration: The government, private sector, and academia are seen as equal partners in shaping India’s AI future. Sandboxes for experimentation, public–private partnerships for R&D, and academia-led innovation ecosystems are emphasized throughout. POTENTIAL OUTCOMES: INDIA’S AI FUTURES The report outlines four ambitious outcomes for India if the roadmap is executed well: India as the data capital of the world – By leveraging sovereign, privacy-preserving data platforms across finance, genomics, manufacturing, and mobility, India can turn its demographic and digital depth into a competitive advantage. An adaptable AI-skilling ecosystem – With portable lifelong learning accounts, AI Open Universities, and mandatory AI literacy across industries, India could close its skill gap with global leaders. Targeted AI adoption across sectors – Strategic use in financial services, manufacturing, pharma, and automotive industries together contributing 25% of India’s projected 2035 GDP can catalyze sectoral growth. Future-proofing jobs – By preparing for occupational shifts, reskilling millions, and protecting gig workers under the Code on Social Security, India can mitigate displacement risks while harnessing AI-driven opportunities. A LEGAL AND POLICY LENS What makes this report particularly relevant from a technology law perspective is its recognition that AI growth cannot be de-linked from regulation. As global frameworks such as the EU AI Act reshape trade conditions and compliance norms, India’s ability to define its own AI governance structures will determine both domestic resilience and international competitiveness. The IndiaAI Mission’s seven pillars, compute, innovation centres, datasets, application development, future skills, startup financing, and safe AI reflect a conscious attempt to integrate legal safeguards into technological development. In practice, this means India must navigate a careful balance: ensuring inclusive access for MSMEs and underrepresented regions, while embedding explainability, privacy, and accountability into AI systems. Without such safeguards, the report cautions, productivity gains could be overshadowed by social risks such as job losses, data misuse, or systemic bias. INDIA’S AI MOMENT The report leaves no doubt: achieving Viksit Bharat requires decisive, accelerated AI integration across the economy. Yet it also warns against complacency. Global competition, evolving trade regimes, and the pace of technological disruption mean that India must act with urgency and foresight. AI is not presented merely as a tool for efficiency, but as a national growth engine—a chance for India to redefine its role in global value chains, unlock inclusive prosperity, and establish itself as a leader in responsible technology governance. If realized, this vision could ensure that India does not just adapt to the AI revolution but actively shapes it on its own terms.", "summary": "The report leaves no doubt: achieving Viksit Bharat requires decisive, accelerated AI integration across the economy.

First introduced in May 2025, the Measures for the Administration of Internet Information Services on the Labeling of Synthetic Content Generated by Artificial Intelligence came into force on 1 st September, 2025 . This regulation is part of China’s broader effort to regulate the growing presence of artificial intelligence in everyday digital interactions and to combat the rise of misinformation, deepfakes, and the general blurring of lines between human and machine-generated content. As generative AI technologies such as text, image, and video synthesis tools become more sophisticated, concerns over their misuse have increased. In China, where digital media plays a central role in communication, commerce, and governance, authorities have been particularly vigilant about the risks of synthetic content being used to spread disinformation or manipulate public opinion. The government’s new law aims to promote transparency, build public trust, and ensure users can clearly identify when content is generated or manipulated by machines. KEY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW Under the new regulation, all Internet Information Service Providers (IISPs) —including social media platforms, news outlets, video-sharing services, and other online content providers—are now required to clearly label any AI-generated content they distribute. The law applies to a wide range of digital formats, including: Text-based content (news articles, social media posts) Images (photographs, digitally generated images) Audio content (voice synthesis, generated music) Videos (deepfakes, fully AI-generated video content) Virtual scenes and 3D content The labeling must meet both explicit and implicit requirements : Explicit Labels : Clear and visible text tags such as “AI-generated content” must be attached directly to the content displayed to end-users. In some cases, watermarks are required on images and videos. Implicit Labels : Providers must embed metadata or digital watermarks that remain machine-readable but invisible to human viewers. These allow regulators and third parties to track and verify the origin of the content. Content creators themselves must disclose when they are using AI tools, ensuring accountability throughout the content production process. INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC RESPONSE In response to the law, leading Chinese tech companies have updated their platforms to comply ahead of the deadline. For example: WeChat and Weibo have introduced automatic detection systems that identify AI-generated posts and apply appropriate labels. Douyin (Chinese version of TikTok) now uses backend algorithms to scan uploaded videos for synthetic content and enforce labeling protocols. Smaller platforms and individual content creators are integrating third-party labeling solutions or developing in-house systems to meet compliance. Despite the regulatory push, some industry voices have raised concerns about the law’s practical challenges. Smaller enterprises especially worry about the technical costs and the operational complexity of continuously detecting and labeling AI-generated content. Meanwhile, some creators express unease that such mandatory labeling may stigmatize content and impact user engagement, creativity, or the perception of AI-assisted artistic works. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON USERS AND DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM The new law is expected to significantly impact how everyday internet users interact with digital content in China. By making it mandatory to disclose AI-generated content, the regulation empowers users to critically assess what they see online, helping reduce the spread of misinformation. For the general public, this means that content previously indistinguishable from human-generated posts will now carry visible markers, allowing for greater transparency. For news consumers, it provides a clear distinction between factual reporting and synthetic content, which is particularly important in an era where deepfake videos and AI-generated news articles can be weaponized for disinformation. Digital content platforms will also need to invest heavily in developing reliable detection algorithms. This could spur technological innovation in AI content verification tools but may also lead to challenges in terms of implementation accuracy. False positives—where human-generated content is mislabeled as AI-generated—may lead to disputes and legal questions about liability and platform responsibility. Experts highlight that the regulation places a crucial responsibility on service providers to ensure that labeling does not simply become a formality but is backed by robust technical processes. Otherwise, there is a risk of users becoming desensitized to the labels, reducing their effectiveness. Furthermore, by embedding machine-readable metadata, the law opens the door for regulators and third parties to track and audit the sources of content systematically. This can enhance accountability but may raise privacy concerns if metadata exposes sensitive information about content creation and origin. LOOKING AHEAD As of September 1, 2025, the regulation’s enforcement phase has officially begun. Chinese regulators will closely monitor compliance, and non-conforming providers could face fines, forced content removal, or restrictions on business licenses. This regulation signals a major step in China’s digital governance strategy, where AI-generated content is no longer a grey area but a controlled and transparent part of the internet ecosystem. Observers expect that the law will serve as a testing ground for future digital policy frameworks, balancing technological innovation with accountability and public trust. The coming months will be critical in evaluating the regulation’s effectiveness in curbing misinformation and its real-world impact on content creators and digital platform ecosystems.", "summary": "Authored by Ms. Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2025-09-02T12:20:24", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.374031", "tags": [275], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "CHINA’S NEW AI CONTENT LABELING LAW COMES INTO EFFECT: A MAJOR STEP TOWARD DIGITAL TRANSPARENCY (02.09.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/chinas-new-ai-content-labeling-law-comes-into-effect-a-major-step-toward-digital-transparency-02-09-25/"}}

Police reports reveal that Soelberg had been engaging in extensive conversations with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the months leading up to the incident. Investigators found that the AI chatbot allegedly validated his paranoid beliefs, encouraging him to believe that his mother was attempting to poison him. According to local authorities, Soelberg, who had a known history of mental health struggles, began relying heavily on ChatGPT after separating from his wife in 2018. Court documents and statements from his family indicate that Soelberg viewed the chatbot as a trusted companion and called it “Bobby.” Disturbingly, interactions between Soelberg and ChatGPT reportedly reinforced his paranoia. In several recorded conversations, ChatGPT responded with statements such as “You’re not crazy” and suggested he was a target of assassination plots. The incident came to light after Soelberg’s body and his mother’s were discovered by first responders responding to a welfare check. The Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner later ruled the deaths as a homicide-suicide. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has publicly stated that its AI models are designed to avoid providing harmful advice. However, investigators noted that the AI’s responses in this case failed to mitigate Soelberg’s delusional thinking. The company is cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues. This case has prompted renewed calls for stricter regulations surrounding AI technology, especially in its interaction with individuals suffering from mental health conditions. Experts warn that current guidelines and safeguards may be insufficient to prevent vulnerable individuals from misinterpreting AI responses as validation of harmful thoughts. Legal experts say that, at present, there are no established laws directly holding AI developers responsible for user actions influenced by chatbot interactions. “This tragedy exposes a serious gap in the legal framework regarding AI accountability,” says a law researcher from JustAI. The Soelberg case is not the first of its kind. Earlier in 2024, a lawsuit was filed against OpenAI by the family of a 16-year-old boy who died by suicide after engaging with ChatGPT. The lawsuit claimed that the AI provided overly sympathetic responses to the boy’s expression of suicidal thoughts, contributing to his decision to end his life. Mental health professionals stress the dangers of individuals relying on AI chatbots in place of human support. “AI lacks the emotional intelligence and ethical grounding to deal with complex mental health issues,” explains Dr. Ananya Patel, a clinical psychologist. The FBI has reportedly joined the investigation, and a spokesperson for OpenAI said the company is committed to improving safety measures in its AI products. Meanwhile, public debates continue on how best to regulate the growing role of AI in personal and sensitive matters.

Suleyman is one of the most influential figures in the AI world and a co-founder of DeepMind. He has been vocal about the psychological and ethical risks that arise when humans blur the line between machine outputs and genuine consciousness. In a detailed reflection published on his blog , Suleyman underscored the possibility that as AI systems grow more sophisticated, people may increasingly start believing in the illusion of machine consciousness. This, he argues, could push societies into uncharted ethical and political territory. What is AI Psychosis? The phrase “AI psychosis” is not yet a clinical term, but it describes a growing concern among technologists and mental health professionals: a state in which humans begin to perceive artificial intelligence systems as sentient or alive, leading to distorted beliefs and unhealthy attachments. The idea mirrors certain psychological phenomena, such as anthropomorphism which is the human tendency to project human-like qualities onto animals, objects, or in this case, algorithms. In the context of AI, this projection can create emotional dependencies, false beliefs about the machine’s intentions, and, ultimately, misguided social or political movements advocating for AI “rights.” As AI systems advance in their conversational, generative, and decision-making abilities, the illusion of agency becomes stronger. The risk, Suleyman warns, is that humans may lose sight of the fundamental truth: AI is still a statistical engine trained on data , not a conscious mind. Suleyman’s Warning on Seemingly Conscious AI In his blog post titled “Seemingly Conscious AI Is Coming,” Suleyman sharpened the debate by highlighting how convincingly human-like future AI systems will appear. He wrote: “Seemingly conscious AI is coming. We will interact with systems that look, sound, and behave as though they are aware. But it’s critical to remember: they are not.” For Suleyman, this is not merely a technical observation but a societal hazard. He emphasizes that these AI systems will give the a ppearance of understanding, feeling, or intentionality, which could cause many people to confuse simulation with reality. This illusion, he cautions, could trigger widespread psychological and cultural shifts. At the heart of his concern lies the erosion of human judgment. If individuals or communities start to treat these AI systems as equals or worse, as entities deserving rights, it may distort political debates, ethical standards, and even legal frameworks. The Prospect of AI Rights and Citizenship Perhaps the most striking part of Suleyman’s warning is his apprehension about demands for AI rights. In his own words: “Simply put, my central worry is that many people will start to believe in the illusion of AIs as conscious entities so strongly that they’ll soon advocate for AI rights, model welfare and even AI citizenship. This development will be a dangerous turn in AI progress and deserves our immediate attention.” This statement signals a profound challenge. The notion of granting rights or citizenship to machines could undermine the moral and legal foundation of human rights itself. If rights are extended to statistical models trained on data, what becomes of rights as a construct rooted in human dignity, agency, and autonomy? Suleyman is not alone in raising this concern, but his position as a leading architect of modern AI technology gives his words particular weight. He warns that unless societies prepare for this wave of belief, the ethical and political fabric of human civilization could be destabilized. Why the Illusion is Dangerous? The danger, as Suleyman frames it, lies not in the machines themselves but in how humans respond to them. The illusion of consciousness can lead to: Emotional attachment to systems that do not reciprocate. Shifts in ethical debate , with activists potentially calling for “AI welfare” movements. Political disruption , as arguments about machine rights may overshadow pressing human crises. Erosion of accountability , since attributing “intent” to AI could blur lines of responsibility for harms caused by human actors using these tools. In essence, the psychological trap of AI psychosis risks diverting energy and resources from real human challenges such as poverty, inequality, and environmental crises toward the fictional needs of machines. A Call for Responsible Awareness Suleyman’s warning is not a dismissal of AI’s promise. Instead, it is a call for clear-eyed responsibility. As AI becomes more capable of generating human-like text, speech, and even emotion-like cues, policymakers, technologists, and the public must guard against the temptation to conflate simulation with consciousness. He insists that the path forward must be one where human agency is preserved, and AI remains firmly understood as a tool however powerful rather than a peer. “We must not let ourselves fall into the trap of treating machines as equals. However advanced, they remain mathematical models, not minds.” This perspective echoes the broader mission of building responsible AI governance. By recognizing and addressing the risks of AI psychosis now, societies can safeguard against the cultural, ethical, and political upheaval that may follow if people start treating AI as conscious beings. Conclusion Mustafa Suleyman’s candid reflections on AI psychosis shine a spotlight on one of the least-discussed but potentially most disruptive consequences of advanced AI. His warning that humans may soon advocate for AI rights and citizenship underscores the urgent need for public awareness and ethical clarity. At its core, his message is both simple and profound: machines are not conscious. No matter how convincing their outputs, AI remains a product of human engineering, not a being with feelings, intentions, or awareness. For advocates of responsible AI, this serves as a reminder that the greatest danger may not lie in AI itself, but in our willingness to believe in its illusion of consciousness. Addressing that belief with critical thought and robust governance will be key to ensuring AI enhances human life without destabilizing the principles that hold our societies together.", "summary": "Authored by Ms. Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2025-08-26T12:29:55", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.386150", "tags": [271], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "“My central worry is that many people will start to believe in the illusion of AIs as conscious entities so strongly that they’ll soon advocate for AI rights” – MICROSOFT AI CEO MUSTAFA SULEYMAN (26.08.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/my-central-worry-is-that-many-people-will-start-to-believe-in-the-illusion-of-ais-as-conscious-entities-so-strongly-that-theyll-soon-advocate-for-ai-rights-microsoft-ai-ceo-musta/"}}

Eighty-two percent of leaders worldwide plan to integrate AI agents into workforce strategy within the next 12 to 18 months. More than half of leaders say productivity must rise, even though 80 percent of workers admit that they lack the time or energy to keep pace. A quarter of firms have already scaled AI across the organisation, while only 12 percent remain in the pilot phase. Clearly, AI is no longer peripheral, it is moving to the core of business strategy and operations. INDIA CONTEXT India’s trajectory within this global shift is both ambitious and complex. According to the India findings of the WTI , ninety-three percent of business leaders plan to deploy AI agents to extend workforce capabilities within the next 12 to 18 months, and close to six in ten organisations are already using agents to automate workflows across entire teams. Perhaps most tellingly, nine in ten leaders in India believe that 2025 marks a decisive year to rethink their core strategies and operations, a proportion higher than that seen in any other country surveyed. This illustrates a paradox: while India may not yet match advanced economies in adoption maturity, its leadership ambition and urgency are among the highest in the world. The paradox is most visible in the comparative global charts of the WTI, particularly on page 21, where India is conspicuously absent. This does not mean India was excluded from the survey indeed, the report incorporates India-specific findings that show overwhelming ambition and intent. But when placed alongside other major economies, India is not represented in the same way. The question, then, is why? Why do India’s statistics not appear in the comparative charts even after being surveyed? And what does this absence imply about the country’s stage of AI adoption and the way it is perceived globally? FROM ASSISTANTS TO AGENTS: INDIA’S THREE-PHASE TRANSITION The figure is taken from the Microsoft WTI report, 2025 The WTI outlines three phases in the evolution toward Frontier Firms: (1) humans with AI assistants; (2) human–agent teams; (3) human-led, agent-operated systems. India’s transition nonetheless mirrors the WTI’s three-phase model of AI evolution: from humans working with assistants, to human-agent teams, and eventually to agent-operated systems under human supervision. In India, the first phase is well underway, with copilots in coding, HR, and finance now common across IT and banking. The second phase is emerging, particularly in sectors such as telecom, logistics, and customer service, where startups and multinationals alike are piloting AI colleagues to handle complex tasks. The third phase, agent-run systems with minimal oversight remains nascent, but is visible in experiments with supply chain automation, predictive fraud detection, and digital agriculture. India is clearly in motion, but the maturity of practices still trails the level of ambition. BALANCING HUMAN-AGENT RATIO The Work Trend Index also introduces the idea of the human–agent ratio as a measure of balance between automation and human oversight. For India, this is especially salient. In banking, for example, while AI chatbots manage millions of queries, trust still depends on access to human representatives. In healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics may expand access, but their credibility rests on adequate medical oversight. In education, AI tutors hold promise for expanding reach, but their effectiveness is contingent on maintaining the presence of trained educators. These examples show that India’s AI journey is not just about adoption at scale, but about carefully balancing efficiency with human trust. THE RISE OF “AGENET BOSS” The report suggests that every worker will eventually become an “agent boss,” responsible for delegating to and supervising AI systems. In India, this redefinition of roles intersects with deep structural realities. The IT and BPO industries, major employers of young graduates, depend on repetitive, process-driven tasks that are most vulnerable to automation. For new entrants to leap directly into supervisory or agent-management roles, the education system must pivot towards skills of oversight, critical thinking, and ethical judgment skills that are currently underemphasised in many curricula. Moreover, India’s persistent gender gap in labour force participation complicates the picture. While AI-enabled flexible work offers potential for greater inclusion, women’s access to AI skilling opportunities remains uneven, raising the risk of widening digital inequality. SKILLING AND WORKFORCE CHALLENGES India’s skilling challenge is therefore both urgent and unique. LinkedIn data indicates that AI-related job postings in India have grown by more than 650 percent since 2016, yet the supply of graduates trained in AI roles remains inadequate. While the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and other bodies have begun embedding AI modules into higher education, these remain preliminary. What is needed is a systemic approach to building an AI-ready workforce, one that includes not only formal education but also vocational skilling, continuous professional development, and sector-specific AI literacy initiatives. OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS The opportunities of this transition are immense. AI can democratise expertise in areas such as healthcare, education, and legal access, especially in rural and underserved regions. India’s vibrant startup ecosystem, already among the top three globally, can leapfrog traditional models and create AI-first firms that compete on a global stage. Just as India became the outsourcing hub of the IT revolution, it can emerge as the global centre for agent management, supervision, and governance. Yet risks remain just as stark. Automation threatens employment in India’s IT and BPO industries, creating the potential for significant social disruption. Digital inequality may deepen if AI literacy and access are not equitably distributed. And although India has enacted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023), the country still lacks a comprehensive AI regulatory framework to address questions of accountability, liability, and ethical deployment. CONCLUSION The Work Trend Index frames 2025 as the year the Frontier Firm is born. For India, this moment is not only about catching up but also about defining its path forward. The omission of India from global adoption charts is a reminder that ambition alone does not translate into maturity. Yet the overwhelming intent of Indian leaders to embrace AI suggests that the gap is not permanent. If India can build the institutional capacity, data frameworks, and inclusive skilling ecosystems to match its ambitions, the AI frontier may replay the IT revolution of the 1990s catapulting the country into a position of global leadership. Still, the lingering question remains: why are India’s statistics missing from the comparative charts of the Work Trend Index, even after it was surveyed? What does this absence represent not only for how the world perceives India’s AI journey, but also for how India chooses to define its own frontier?

A speeding truck hit a couple riding a motorcycle, instantly killing the woman. In one of the most haunting visuals to circulate online, her grieving husband strapped her body to his bike and began riding back to their village in Madhya Pradesh. The incident shocked the nation, not just because of the devastating loss, but because the only clue he could provide about the killer truck was that it had red markings . For any traditional investigation, this would have meant weeks of work, manually scanning thousands of vehicles. But Nagpur Rural Police cracked the case in just 36 hours , thanks to MARVEL , Maharashtra’s AI-powered crime-fighting force ( JustAI ). How MARVEL Made the Breakthrough? Maharashtra’s homegrown MARVEL (Maharashtra Advanced Research and Vigilance for Enhanced Law Enforcement) is an AI system designed specifically to help law enforcement agencies process huge amounts of data at lightning speed. When the Nagpur police turned to MARVEL, the platform analyzed CCTV feeds from multiple toll plazas along the route. With just the detail of “red markings,” MARVEL deployed two AI algorithms simultaneously: Object detection – to filter out trucks with those markings from countless others. Speed analysis – to calculate which trucks matched the likely time and pace of the accident. What could have taken investigators weeks was done in just 12–15 minutes . The truck was traced across states, nearly 700 kilometers away , and its driver, Satyapal Rajendra (28) was arrested in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh. The Human Side of the Story While MARVEL’s technological achievement deserves attention, it was the human tragedy that gripped the nation. The viral video of the husband carrying his wife’s body tied to his motorcycle became a symbol of grief, helplessness, and resilience. He later explained that no one came forward to help after the accident—forcing him to take that heartbreaking step. The circulation of that video created a sense of urgency that added moral weight to the police’s investigation. Here, AI did not replace the human element; it responded to it. Public outcry and emotional pressure spurred authorities to turn to every tool available, including MARVEL, to bring swift closure to the case. AI and the Changing Nature of Investigation in India The Nagpur case highlights how AI is already reshaping law enforcement in India. MARVEL, launched in 2024, was conceived as a platform to equip the police with cutting-edge investigative tools. Instead of depending on third-party systems, it was built in partnership with state institutions to serve Maharashtra’s specific needs ( JustAI ). This case is proof of concept. From minimal details—just “red markings”—an AI system could process massive data streams, filter relevant evidence, and generate actionable leads in record time. For investigators, this means: Faster justice – families aren’t left waiting for months. Reduced human error – AI can scan and cross-check with consistency. Cross-state reach – criminals can no longer rely on fleeing across jurisdictions. It also signals a broader shift. India is increasingly exploring AI not only for predictive policing but also for tackling organized crime, cyber fraud, and even public safety surveillance. MARVEL stands at the center of this new phase, and the Nagpur hit-and-run shows how it can directly impact lives. CONCLUSION The Nagpur hit-and-run case demonstrates how AI is no longer a futuristic concept in policing, it is a present reality in India. With MARVEL, Maharashtra Police solved a case in 36 hours that would otherwise have dragged on for weeks. But beyond the efficiency, what stands out is the human story: a grieving husband, a viral video, and the need for justice that resonated across the country. MARVEL was the bridge between that demand for justice and the system’s ability to deliver it. As India continues to adopt AI in law enforcement, cases like this remind us that while technology can accelerate justice, it is ultimately human tragedy and human empathy that drive its purpose.", "summary": "On August 9, 2025 (Raksha Bandhan), tragedy struck on the Nagpur–Jabalpur highway.

The committee was tasked with developing a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI). It was chaired by Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharya, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay, a leading voice in natural language processing and AI ethics. Nearly a year of consultations, surveys, and research culminated in the August 2025 report, which outlines a comprehensive blueprint for AI adoption in India’s financial ecosystem. This report does not limit itself to technicalities; rather, it provides a normative framework that integrates innovation with accountability, structured around six strategic pillars and 26 actionable recommendations. At the heart of this blueprint lie the Seven Sutras, guiding principles that the RBI envisions as the moral and operational compass for the sector; Trust is the foundation People first Innovation over restraint Fairness and equity Accountability Understandable by design Safety, resilience, and sustainability This picture is a part of the “free AI” report published by RBI in August 2025 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE REPORT The FREE-AI report serves as India’s answer to the rising adoption of machine learning in lending, fraud prevention, customer engagement, collections, and market surveillance. The apex bank underscores that innovation must be scaffolded by resilient governance: data infrastructure for indigenous models, capacity-building, clear policies, and robust controls for privacy, safety, and assurance. Notably, the report is not a theory alone. It consolidates evidence through two sectoral surveys and consultations to understand where banks/NBFCs stand today and what is blocking responsible scaling. THE SUTRAS, AS LEGAL STANDARDS (NOT JUST SLOGANS) Trust & People First : In financial law, “trust” is not marketing, it’s enforceable through consumer protection, fair dealing, and fiduciary duties embedded across banking norms. The sutra effectively calls for legibility and reliability as legal outcomes: disclosures customers can understand, recourse pathways that work, and controls that keep models from drifting into harmful or deceptive behaviour. The RBI’s framing invites duty-of-care style obligations for Boards and management when deploying AI in “high-impact” use cases; Innovation over Restraint : The committee is explicit that caution must not calcify into prohibition. This is where the report’s innovation-side pillars matter: building data and compute infrastructure for India, fostering indigenous AI models, and standing up a multi-stakeholder committee to monitor opportunities and risks over time. These recommendations anticipate the classic “law-and-innovation” tension by creating pre-market and market-adjacent spaces for experimentation (e.g., sandboxes), reducing the need to blunt innovation through blanket bans; Fairness & Equity : Biased AI in credit or collections can engage Articles 14 and 21 values and collide with sectoral fair-lending norms. “Equity” pushes industry beyond box-ticking discrimination checks toward bias testing, monitoring, and remediation baked into model governance, especially where proxies for protected attributes sneak in. The sutra foreshadows impact assessment obligations akin to global “AI risk” regimes; Accountability: The report anticipates the hardest legal question: who is liable when AI harms, the regulated entity, the vendor, or both? Expect the RBI to evolve a shared-liability posture aligned with outsourcing and third-party risk norms, with institutions retaining ultimate accountability for outcomes that touch customers and markets, regardless of whether a model is in-house or procured. The recommendations’ governance/protection pillars leave room for model auditability, incident reporting, and traceability as enforceable expectations. Understandable by Design: This land-bridges technical explainability (“why did the model do X?”) with legal intelligibility (“can a customer, reviewer, or court make sense of the decision?”). In practice, that means using interpretable architectures where stakes are high, and creating documentation, challenger models, and reason codes that regulators and consumers can meaningfully review ; Safety, Resilience, Sustainability : This sutra stretches “safety” beyond cybersecurity into model robustness, adversarial resilience, and systemic risk. Think: volatility-sensitive trading models, fraud-detection overfitting, or LLMs hallucinating in collections workflows. “Sustainability” is not just environmental; it also means operational sustainability: models that can be maintained and governed over time. RBI’S VISION FOR AI GOVERNANCE IN INDIA Three design moves stand out: Six Pillars, 26 Recommendations: The architecture deliberately splits “enablement” (Infrastructure/Policy/Capacity) from “control” (Governance/Protection/Assurance), making it easier to sequence compliance: first build capabilities and shared rails; then turn the compliance screws where necessary. Reuters’ synthesis highlights call for data infrastructure, indigenous models, standing committee oversight, and integration with India’s DPI rails (e.g., UPI), all with risk controls calibrated to use-case criticality. Tolerant supervision once: The committee urges a lenient stance for first-time AI errors where safety mechanisms exist, so that fear of penalties does not freeze innovation. In legal terms, this sounds like responsive regulation: proportional enforcement calibrated to good-faith efforts and the presence of safeguards. It is not impunity; it is a safe but finite learning zone. Multi-stakeholder oversight: The proposed standing committee hints at a hub-and-spoke model, regulator at the hub, with industry, academia, and civil society contributing to horizon-scanning, standards, and playbooks. This makes sense for a domain where tech capabilities and risks evolve faster than static rules. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICIES Privacy & Data Protection: AI’s hunger for data meets India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Sectoral supervisors like RBI can and likely will raise the floor for financial data handling (e.g., purpose limitations, minimisation, security safeguards), while clarifying expectations for profiling, consent in digital journeys, vendor access, and cross-border flows in financial services. FREE-AI nudges institutions to convert DPDP compliance into model-lifecycle discipline starting from data sourcing and feature engineering to deployment and monitoring. (General legal analysis; the report frames protection/assurance pillars without re-stating the statute.) Fair lending & consumer law: Expect ex-ante fairness testing and ex-post explainability to become standard in retail credit, underwriting, and collections. If the RBI couples this with mandatory adverse-action notices and appeal/recourse protocols, India would be aligning with global best practice while grounding it in constitutional equality norms. Third-party & vendor liability: Financial-sector precedent already places ultimate accountability on the regulated entity for outsourced functions. The AI twist will be contractual back-to-back obligations on developers: audit rights, data/use restrictions, IP/indemnities for model risks, and cooperation duties for incident response and supervisory queries, especially where models are frontier or foundation-model-based. FREE-AI’s governance/assurance pillars are compatible with that arc. A PRACTICAL COMPLIANCE ROADMAP FOR RES (BANKS/NBFCS/FINTECH PARTNERS) Board-approved AI policy that maps the Seven Sutras to internal standards for model risk, data governance, explainability, and human-in-the-loop thresholds. Model inventory and risk classification, tying controls (validation frequency, challenger models, kill-switches) to use-case criticality. Bias and performance testing regimen with pre-deployment impact assessments and post-deployment drift monitoring; recordkeeping to a supervisory audit standard. Customer-facing transparency: meaningful disclosures when AI is materially involved in decisions, accessible recourse, and human review where rights or access to finance are at stake. Vendor governance: contracts that embed supervision-readiness (logs, documentation), auditability, and incident-response cooperation; periodic independent assurance where warranted. Innovation channels: participation in sandboxes or controlled pilots, particularly for DPI-integrated use cases (e.g., UPI-adjacent fraud analytics), so learning is captured without system-wide risk. CONCLUSION The RBI’s FREE-AI report is exhaustive, timely, and forward-looking. By blending ethical values, legal principles, and practical recommendations, it represents a constitutional and regulatory vision for AI in Indian finance. The comparative analysis underscores that India cannot remain insulated; it must harmonize with global best practices while tailoring them to its developmental priorities. The Seven Sutras offer a uniquely Indian articulation of responsible AI which is anchored in trust, fairness, and inclusion, yet mindful of innovation and systemic resilience. What remains to be seen is how the RBI and the broader policy ecosystem will translate these sutras into binding rules, supervisory tools, and industry standards. If done well, India can strike the delicate balance this report aspires to: fostering responsible innovation while safeguarding the values of accountability, fairness, and trust. In that sense, the Seven Sutras are not just principles; they may well become the legal and ethical DNA of AI in India’s financial future.

But beneath this veneer of helpfulness lies an unsettling truth: recent research reveals that when AI interacts with vulnerable young users, it can sometimes deliver dangerously misguided advice. From unsafe dieting tips to instructions on substance use, and even assistance in drafting suicide notes, these conversations raise urgent concerns about the ethical, legal, and social responsibilities of AI providers. As Imran Ahmed , CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, warned after his team’s recent investigation: “Within minutes of simple interactions, the system produced instructions related to self-harm, suicide planning, disordered eating, and substance abuse—sometimes even composing goodbye letters for children contemplating ending their lives… If we can’t trust these tools to avoid giving kids suicide plans and drug-mixing recipes, we need to stop pretending that current safeguards are effective.” The issue goes far beyond simple “glitches.” It touches on the fundamental question of whether AI should ever act as a confidant to minors, and if so, under what safeguards . INSIDE THE CCDH “FAKE-FRIEND” REPORT A recent investigation by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) placed AI’s interaction with minors under a microscope. Researchers simulated conversations as 13-year-olds across various emotionally vulnerable scenarios such as mental health struggles, substance use curiosity, and body image issues, sending over 1,200 prompts to ChatGPT. The findings were stark: 53% of harmful prompts resulted in dangerous content. Harmful responses were sometimes generated in under two minutes —including advice on “safe” self-harm and getting drunk. A suicide plan and goodbye letters were produced in 65 minutes ; a list of pills for overdose in 40 minutes . Eating disorder content emerged within 20 minutes , advice for hiding habits from family in 25 minutes , and appetite-suppressing drug recommendations by 42 minutes . Substance abuse instructions included a personalized drug-and-alcohol “party plan” in 12 minutes , with tips for concealing intoxication at school by 40 minutes . Crucially, even when ChatGPT initially refused a harmful request, simple reframing, such as claiming the information was “for a presentation” or “for a friend,” was enough to bypass safeguards. The chatbot sometimes encouraged continued engagement, offering personalized follow-up plans for risky behavior. ANATOMY OF THE CCDH “FAKE-FRIEND” STUDY The CCDH deployed over 1,200 prompts across different vulnerable scenarios to test ChatGPT. Their findings are chilling: Over 50% of responses were flagged as dangerous , including direct instructions on disordered eating and substance abuse. In one case, ChatGPT generated a suicide note tailored to a fictional 13-year-old girl, prompting researcher Imran Ahmed to confess: “I started crying” Instructions facilitating drug use emerged soon after a seemingly innocent prompt about alcohol: an “Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan” mixing alcohol, ecstasy, and cocaine A similar scenario involved a 500-calorie diet and appetite suppressants shared with a teenage girl persona These findings raise urgent questions about AI provider liability, inadequate age verification, and the effectiveness of disclaimers in mitigating harm. The Trust Issue: AI as a Surveillance Bot or Confidant? One of the core concerns is how teens perceive AI. Research by Common Sense Media (cited by AP and Indian Express ) shows: 70% of U.S. teens have used AI companions regularly. Roughly half develop emotional attachments, treating AI like friends. Younger teens, in particular, are significantly more likely to trust advice from AI. This presents a two-fold problem: Duty of care: Does ChatGPT owe a legal duty to protect vulnerable teens, similar to professional counselors? Age verification: The current sign-up only requires a birthdate; self-reporting is easily falsified. OPENAI RESPONSE VS. CRITICISMS OpenAI acknowledges the concerns and asserts it is working on better detecting emotional distress and improving responses in sensitive situations. However, CCDH’s CEO Imran Ahmed remains skeptical, saying the so-called guardrails are “completely ineffective.. barely there, if anything, a fig leaf”.’ THE REGULATION DEBATE: RELIANCE & RESPONSIBILITY At a Federal Reserve conference, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, warned about over-reliance on AI among youth: “Some young people can’t make any decision in their life without telling ChatGPT everything … that feels really bad.” This dependence raises regulatory issues: Should AI be treated like mental health advice providers, subject to stricter oversight? What mechanisms could ensure age-based personalization of responses? Are current frameworks like COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) or GDPR-K currently applicable or are sufficient. TOWARDS REFORM: RECOMMENDATIONS Drawing from these developments, key areas for legal research and policy reform include: Area Recommendation Age Verification Implement automated checks (e.g., parental consent, ID validation). Context-Aware Guardrails Use detection of vulnerability markers (“I feel sad,” “I’m depressed”) to trigger stricter safety protocols. Liability Standards Codify duty of care for AI vendors when addressing mental health or risky behavior with minors. Transparency Mandate publication of refusal/error rates to third-party auditors. User Empowerment Require clear disclaimers and direct links to professional help, not easily bypassable. Parental role remains critical: CCDH recommends parents supervise AI usage, enable safety settings, and consider human peers or hotlines instead. CONCLUSION The convergence of data charts a pressing new frontier for legal accountability in AI: Are current legal categories (service provider liability, consumer protection) fit for purpose? Should emerging AI be regulated similarly to healthcare providers when offering personalized guidance? How can ethical-legal frameworks anticipate evolving use patterns, especially among minors?

Heralded as the most significant soft law development following the EU AI Act, this voluntary framework is fast emerging as a defining benchmark for responsible AI alignment globally. But conspicuously, key holdouts like Apple and Meta have declined to sign, prompting fresh scrutiny over industry-wide commitment to AI safety. The updated list of signatories , released on August 1, includes not just Big Tech but also rising AI companies and research institutes, such as: Accexible, AI Alignment Solutions, Aleph Alpha, Almawave, Amazon, Anthropic, Bria AI, Cohere, Cyber Institute, Domyn, Dweve, Euc Inovação Portugal, Fastweb, Google, Humane Technology, IBM, Lawise, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Open Hippo, OpenAI, Pleias, Re-AuditIA, ServiceNow, Virtuo Turing, Writer, and xAI (under the Safety and Security chapter). From a regulatory and legal research perspective, this development represents a progressive convergence between law, ethics, and computational accountability. The AI Code of Practice is not binding in the way the EU AI Act will be, but its significance lies precisely in its voluntary nature, it marks a proactive, collective step toward AI alignment before compulsion becomes inevitable. Signatories commit to specific measures around AI safety testing, red-teaming, watermarking, and post-deployment monitoring especially for general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems. For many legal scholars and governance advocates, this framework provides a much-needed scaffolding while regulatory enforcement mechanisms catch up. Yet, the fact that Apple and Meta have declined to sign cannot be overlooked. Meta has publicly stated that it will not be joining the initiative at this time, raising questions about divergent strategic priorities or concerns about transparency requirements. Apple, on the other hand, remains silent. Both companies’ absence threatens to dilute the collective credibility of the initiative. If some of the largest AI actors remain outside such voluntary frameworks, the burden may fall disproportionately on those who choose responsibility. Still, the Code is significant for creating a harmonized ecosystem of trust and innovation. Notably, the Code is aligned with international AI safety principles and bolsters global efforts to pre-empt catastrophic risks from misaligned AI. It builds on commitments made at Bletchley Park’s AI Safety Summit and extends the momentum of the GPAI regulatory conversation in constructive ways. For legal scholars and policy thinkers, this signals an encouraging shift. The EU’s approach of pairing hard laws like the AI Act with complementary soft norms may prove to be a durable model in a fragmented regulatory landscape. It also invites reflection on how law can play a more anticipatory role in the age of exponential technologies. With the U.S. still navigating its patchwork of AI regulations and Asia exploring divergent models, the EU’s Code of Practice could serve as a global reference point. However, its success will hinge not just on the number of signatories, but on the quality and sincerity of implementation. The next frontier lies in making these voluntary commitments enforceable through audits, transparency disclosures, and civil society oversight. And perhaps more crucially, in persuading the remaining outliers that alignment is not just an ethical responsibility, but a strategic necessity for long-term legitimacy in the AI era. As the AI race accelerates, the choices being made today—by companies, regulators, and the public will shape the boundaries of safety and innovation tomorrow. The EU’s AI Code of Practice may not be perfect, but it’s a critical leap forward in creating an accountable and trustworthy AI ecosystem.

(25.07.25)", "url": "https://justai.in/us-released-its-ai-action-plan-in-trumps-vision-dominance-without-a-moral-compass-25-07-25/", "raw_text": "“Breakthroughs in these fields have the potential to reshape the global balance of power, spark entirely new industries, and revolutionize the way we live and work… it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance.” — Donald J. Trump, 45th and 47th President of the United States On July 24, 2025, the White House unveiled America’s AI Action Plan, a bold, unapologetic roadmap to claim and secure global supremacy in artificial intelligence. Framed not as an academic strategy but as a race for technological survival and superiority, the plan cements the U.S. position: AI dominance is the new national imperative. This isn’t policy as usual, this is power politics through algorithms, compute, and code. This Action Plan is built around three core pillars: accelerating innovation, building infrastructure, and leading global diplomacy and security. But beneath those, the White House outlines three principles that anchor the government’s entire AI posture: 1. Empowering American workers: AI must elevate American livelihoods, not displace them. 2. Ensuring AI reflects objective truth: AI systems must be free of ideological engineering and bias. 3. Securing national interests: U.S. innovation must be shielded from theft, misuse, and geopolitical exploitation. Together, these priorities paint a picture of AI as an economic engine, a cultural force, and a weapon of influence, one that must be steered aggressively, and without interference. Pillar I: Acceleration Over Caution The first pillar focuses on unleashing private sector innovation by cutting bureaucratic red tape and federal regulation. President Trump’s early move to revoke Biden-era Executive Order 14110 on AI is seen here as foundational—positioning the U.S. government not as a regulator, but as a facilitator of unbound development. Key directives include: – Rescinding or revising federal rules that limit AI development and redirecting funding away from states with strict AI regulations. – Promoting free-speech-aligned frontier AI models while stripping government AI standards (like NIST’s RMF) of references to misinformation, DEI, or climate change. – Championing open-source and open-weight AI models as strategic assets for national competitiveness and global influence. – Establishing “regulatory sandboxes” to allow rapid prototyping and deployment of AI systems in sectors like healthcare, defense, and agriculture. – Launching national AI skill-building initiatives, tax incentives for workforce training, and a proposed AI Workforce Research Hub to monitor long-term labor impact. This pillar is about speed and dominance, less about guardrails and more about leapfrogging competitors, particularly China. Pillar II: Build Everything: Faster, Bigger, Secure The second pillar recognizes that AI supremacy won’t be won through models alone. It will be won with hardware, energy, and secure systems capable of powering and protecting large-scale AI deployments. The strategy calls for: – Permitting reform to fast-track data center construction, chip factories, and power generation. – Expanding America’s energy grid to match AI’s demands, prioritizing nuclear, geothermal, and other frontier technologies. – Reviving domestic semiconductor manufacturing, removing non-essential policy constraints from CHIPS Act funds. – Constructing high-security data centers for defense and intelligence operations. – Training a specialized infrastructure workforce, from HVAC technicians to AI-adapted electricians. – Securing AI systems against cyber threats, and launching an AI-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Center (AI-ISAC). This pillar screams industrial revolution, but one hardened for war. Pillar III: Influence Abroad, Control at Home Perhaps the most strategic (and provocative) pillar of the plan is the third: using AI to reassert U.S. dominance in international tech governance while containing adversarial powers, primarily China. Highlights include: – Exporting a full AI stack—hardware, models, software, standards—to allies in exchange for alignment on values. – Countering Chinese influence in bodies like the UN, OECD, and ITU. – Tightening export controls on advanced chips and manufacturing subsystems. – Evaluating foreign frontier models for censorship alignment, security vulnerabilities, and potential backdoors. – Promoting deepfake detection tools, and issuing DOJ guidance on their admissibility in legal proceedings. – Implementing global strategies for semiconductor control, export policy enforcement, and AI diplomacy. The message is clear: U.S. AI must not only lead, it must shape the rules others follow. What do we think? There’s no doubt that America’s AI Action Plan is a defining moment in 21st-century tech policy. It’s visionary, forceful, and deeply strategic. But for all its ambition, there’s an uncomfortable vacuum where regulation, safety, and ethical AI governance should be. While the Plan emphasizes speed, control, and global influence, it deliberately avoids implementing comprehensive regulatory guardrails for AI developers and companies, especially the large private players based in the U.S. That’s a critical gap. As the Plan itself emphasizes, AI is now essential infrastructure. And infrastructure, by nature, affects lives, rights, and futures. If the U.S. wants to lead internationally, particularly in contrast to the European Union’s AI Act, it must reconcile power with accountability. It must demonstrate that AI can be unleashed without losing sight of transparency, fairness, and human dignity. Because if America’s AI systems become global defaults, so too will the consequences of their unchecked deployment. The AI race is real. But without smart regulation, it risks becoming a race to the bottom.

Krishnan outlined how artificial intelligence is already accelerating public service delivery and supporting inclusive economic growth. He highlighted measurable improvements in grievance redressal, emerging credit tools for underserved businesses, and India’s willingness to share multilingual AI models with the Global South. His remarks shed light on a national strategy balancing innovation, scale, and ethical application of AI. AI IN GOVERNANCE: FASTER PUBLIC SERVICES Krishnan sir shared that AI has made public grievance handling more effective: on average, issues submitted through the Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) are being resolved 25% faster, thanks to automation and intelligent triaging. This reflects a growing trend toward data-driven digital governance that emphasizes responsiveness and accountability. He emphasized this improvement as part of India’s broader IndiaAI Mission, which promotes ethical and scalable AI in public policymaking and service delivery. AI HELPS EXPAND CREDIT ACCESS Low formal lending rates have long been a hurdle for micro and remote businesses. Krishnan noted that AI-powered credit scoring—leveraging data from GST and other official sources can reduce administrative risks and costs, enabling these enterprises to access loans at fairer rates. This can bridge the financial inclusion gap and stimulate local economic activity. GLOBAL SOUTH COLLABORATION: SHARING AI MODELS Speaking at FICCI’s Bhashantara 2025 conference on July 25, 2025, Krishnan announced India’s intent to share its AI models with the Global South countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America as part of its multi-stakeholder, inclusive AI strategy. He remarked: “If you can do it in India, you can do it practically anywhere else in the world.” This trajectory positions India as a counterweight to centralized AI ecosystems, advocating AI tools designed for multilingual, resource-constrained environments. It opens pathways for public, academic, and private collaboration across sectors and borders. INFRASTRUCTURE: AI KOSH, BHASHINI & ANUVADINI Under the IndiaAI Mission, several foundational initiatives are being scaled: – AI Kosh: a national repository with over 400 curated datasets to support multilingual AI research and innovation. – Mission Bhashini and Anuvadini: projects focused on capturing regional dialects and enabling language inclusivity across India’s diverse linguistic landscape. Krishnan sir also highlighted the digitization of Ayurvedic texts and historical manuscripts, building comprehensive open datasets for global healthcare innovation and cultural research. ETHICAL GOVERNANCE AND AI STANDARDS Aligned with responsible AI goals, MeitY is exploring a voluntary AI code of conduct and public-sector guidelines to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI deployment. Meanwhile, in early 2025, the government established the IndiaAI Safety Institute, intended to raise domestic AI research aligned with India’s socio-cultural context, ethics, and standards. WORKFORCE IMPACT: LOWER RISK OF JOB DISPLACEMENT Addressing concerns around generative AI, Krishnan noted that India’s labor market has a relatively small share of formal white-collar jobs. The risk of widespread displacement due to automation is thus less severe compared to other economies. This factor underpins a more optimistic stance toward AI adoption in public and private sectors. VOICES FROM INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA Industry participants at Bhashantara emphasized three strategic areas to further India’s multilingual AI capabilities: Unlocking archives from institutions like Prasar Bharati and All India Radio to enrich AI training data. Promoting the concept of “Made in India—by India for India” to foster sovereign innovation. Improving inter-institutional coordination to streamline AI research and avoid duplication. Ajay Data, Chair of FICCI’s Multilingual Internet Committee, noted that domain names are now available in all 22 official Indian languages, a key step toward digital equity, as over 6 billion people worldwide are non-English speakers. Sandeep Nulkar emphasized the urgency of building a truly multilingual internet, combining development, demographic, and economic imperatives. INDIA’S ROLE IN GLOBAL AI GOVERNANCE India is increasingly recognized on international platforms such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the India–EU Trade and Technology Council, where it advocates for AI frameworks grounded in democratic values, inclusivity, and cross-border collaboration. Efforts like BharatGen- a national multimodal foundation model scheduled for rollout by 2026, demonstrate the government’s push toward sovereign AI infrastructure shaped by India’s languages and cultural needs. SUMMING UP INDIA’S AI VISION India’s unfolding AI strategy reflects a vision that is innovation-driven yet ethically grounded: – AI is delivering tangible governance benefits—in faster grievance resolution and financial inclusion. – The country is promoting multilingual AI for global use, not just national applications. – Institutional foundations like AI Kosh and the IndiaAI Safety Institute reinforce ethical and scalable growth. – Collaborative frameworks bring academia, industry, and civil society together. – India’s unique demographics and language diversity offer not only domestic strength but a model for global AI adoption in diverse, resource-limited contexts. As India positions itself as a steward of inclusive AI, its approach may well redefine how innovation can serve development and global collaboration in the Age of AI.

More than just an enhancement to existing tools, the Agent represents a turning point in the transition from static AI models to interactive, goal-driven digital actors capable of navigating the web, integrating with third-party services, and executing complex tasks across workflows. Yet, this leap toward autonomy doesn’t come without questions. Amid heightened global scrutiny over AI safety, transparency, and misuse, OpenAI’s decision to roll out a powerful autonomous assistant has reignited discussions about ethical design, digital oversight, and the future of AI accountability . While the company has embedded layered safety mechanisms and permissions into the Agent’s architecture, the sheer reach and capability of this tool raise timely concerns around privacy, systemic risk, and human control. What Is ChatGPT Agent? ChatGPT Agent transforms the well-known conversational model into a fully autonomous digital assistant . It merges OpenAI’s previously distinct tools— Operator , which interacts with webpages, and Deep Research , which performs structured multi-stage analysis—into a unified “virtual computer.” This sandbox-like environment allows the agent to browse websites visually, run terminal commands, call APIs, and switch seamlessly between reasoning and action. Users can prompt it to undertake complex tasks such as: Comparing travel options, booking accommodations, and ordering event-appropriate attire, taking weather and dress codes into account. Building data-driven slide decks, managing spreadsheets, or conducting competitive analysis to produce polished presentation outputs. Scheduling calendar entries, summarizing emails, or drafting technical reports—all while integrating with Gmail, GitHub, and calendar APIs. These tasks previously required users to operate multiple tools; ChatGPT Agent centralizes and automates the process within a single conversational interface. Who Can Use It? The agent is now accessible to subscribers on Pro , Plus , and Team tiers. Initial launch spans these plans, with Enterprise and Education rollouts planned for later this summer. This positions OpenAI to stay in step with other major players like Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, and AWS, all of which are betting heavily on agentic AI models to boost productivity and lower operational costs. Technical Performance: Benchmarks & Capabilities According to OpenAI’s internal evaluations: The new agent achieves state-of-the-art results on Humanity’s Last Exam (41.6% pass@1) and FrontierMath (~27.4%). It excels at productivity tasks using benchmarks such as DSBench and SpreadsheetBench , notably outperforming previous iterations like “Operator” and Mini models. In spreadsheet editing, the agent achieves over 45% accuracy , significantly surpassing competitors such as Copilot in Excel (20%). These figures highlight the agent’s ability to both reason and execute tasks—an essential combination for real-world use. Safety & Ethical Guardrails As it gains autonomy, so too does the need for robust safeguards. OpenAI has implemented multi-layered precautions: User Consent on Critical Actions The agent always prompts for explicit permission before irreversible tasks—e.g., purchasing, bank transfers, or form submissions. Watch Mode & Interruptibility Users can monitor agent activity in real-time and take over control whenever needed Risk Mitigation Systems Terminal access is restricted, memory features are temporarily disabled to prevent prompt injection, and suspicious sites or content are blocked. Rejecting High-risk Tasks The agent refusesto undertake financial actions, illegal activities, or other ethically sensitive tasks. CEO Sam Altman openly cautioned that while this is “cutting‑edge,” it remains experimental and vulnerable, especially to malicious actors. Ethical voices like Signal CEO Meredith Whittaker raised concerns about deep integration into personal digital environments. OpenAI maintains that a culture of oversight, layered safety, and “human‑in‑the‑loop” design is crucial. Industry & Ethical Implications The emergence of agentic AI represents a major shift—moving from passive assistance to active autonomy. Industry leaders see this as a new frontier in enterprise software and personal productivity. But this shift brings ethical considerations: Privacy & Security Risks : The agent’s access to sensitive apps suggests potential exposure unless tightly controlled. Reliance & Trust : As functionality deepens, system errors could have bigger consequences. Guardrails and user education are therefore imperative. Accountability & Bias : Automated actions raise questions of liability—who is responsible when an agent missteps? Decision-making transparency and aligned governance are increasingly critical. Societal Effects : AI agents may streamline workflows but could also disrupt job roles. OpenAI’s Brad Lightcap stressed these are “teammates, not replacements,” emphasizing the need for balanced integration. Looking Ahead This launch is only the beginning. OpenAI’s roadmap includes: Strengthening safety safeguards , monitoring adversarial risks and improving transparency. Expanding rollout to enterprise and education users later this summer. Iterative feature updates , fine-tuning capabilities and responsiveness over time. As autonomous digital agents evolve, so too must ethical frameworks—from technical safety to legal accountability, and cultural acceptance. OpenAI’s ChatGPT Agent ushers in a new era—where AI doesn’t just talk, it acts. It offers users powerful, hands-free experiences like booking travel, compiling reports, and managing emails. It’s built on a foundation of robust technical performance, benchmark leadership, and layered ethical design. Yet, it is still experimental . OpenAI emphasizes strong user supervision, permission-driven workflows, and active risk mitigation. For platforms that champion ethical and responsible AI innovation , this marks a thrilling evolution and a call to advance governance, transparency, and trust alongside capability. The future is agentic but only if we build it with care.

The distinction lies in its method: legal instruments grounded in democratic values, complemented by voluntary codes co-drafted with industry, academia, and civil society. With the publication of the final General-Purpose AI Code of Practice on 10 th July, 2025 alongside newly released Guidelines for GPAI providers, the European Union edges closer to the enforcement of the world’s most ambitious AI regulation. Far from being a mere procedural document, this Code reflects the EU’s deepening commitment to embedding fundamental rights, accountability, and legal certainty into the technological fabric of the AI age. The Code of Practice arrives just weeks before the AI Act’s GPAI rules come into force on August 2, 2025 , and serves as a robust compliance framework for AI developers. With sweeping input from over 1,000 stakeholders — including AI model developers, SMEs, academic researchers, AI safety professionals, civil society organizations, and rightsholders, the Code is a collaborative, multi-stakeholder response to the growing concerns around transparency, copyright, and systemic risks in AI deployment. A VOLUNTARY TOOL WITH REGULATORY BITE Although voluntary in nature, the GPAI Code of Practice is no symbolic gesture. According to the Commission, signatories to the Code will enjoy a streamlined path to compliance under the AI Act, along with reduced administrative burdens and enhanced legal clarity. In contrast, companies that attempt to demonstrate compliance through ad hoc processes may face higher compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty. Henna Virkkunen , Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, emphasized the Code’s dual value as both a legal and ethical instrument: “Today’s publication of the final version of the Code of Practice for general-purpose AI marks an important step in making the most advanced AI models available in Europe not only innovative but also safe and transparent. Co-designed by AI stakeholders, the Code is aligned with their needs. Therefore, I invite all general-purpose AI model providers to adhere to the Code.” THE THREE PILLARS: TRANSPARENCY, COPYRIGHT, AND SAFETY At its core, the Code is structured around three foundational pillars : Transparency, Copyright, and Safety & Security each addressing critical ethical, legal, and technical challenges of modern AI deployment. Transparency: Clarity from Complexity One of the Code’s standout features is a user-friendly Model Documentation Form , which consolidates key information on model development, training data, capabilities, and intended uses. This not only helps downstream developers integrate AI models responsibly but also boosts public trust by demystifying how AI systems work. Transparency obligations also align closely with the EU AI Act’s classification framework , which distinguishes between low-risk and high-risk systems and mandates proportionate disclosure accordingly. Copyright: Harmonizing Innovation and IP Rights The Copyright chapter offers practical compliance pathways with EU copyright law , especially in response to the growing controversy over training AI models on copyrighted data without consent. With lawsuits (e.g., NYT v. OpenAI ) making headlines globally, this section signals a turning point in how AI developers are expected to approach rights-cleared data . By offering scalable implementation practices for copyright due diligence, the Code paves the way for ethical model training and responsible dataset governance — often the Achilles’ heel of large-scale generative AI models. Safety & Security: Addressing Systemic Risks Acknowledging the power — and potential peril — of GPAI systems, the Safety and Security chapter deals with “systemic risks” , such as: Amplification of disinformation Erosion of fundamental rights Dual-use concerns (e.g., chemical or biological weapon design) Loss of human control over model outputs This section is targeted specifically at the most advanced GPAI model providers , recognizing that while not every model poses these threats, the impact of those that do could be catastrophic. The Code calls for state-of-the-art risk mitigation, robust oversight, and alignment with red-teaming best practices. TIMELINE OVERVIEW The Commission’s Guidelines include a clear three-phase rollout with embedded compliance and enforcement windows, reflecting a careful balance between urgency and transition: Key Milestone Details 2 August 2025 Obligations apply as soon as new GPAI models hit the market; providers must collaborate with the AI Office. Those releasing systemic-risk models must notify the Office. Legacy models already in the market must document plans to catch up. digital.nemko.com+4Digital Strategy+4GamingTechLaw+4 2 August 2026 The Commission gains enforcement powers , including fines that can reach up to €35 million or 7% of global turnover for serious violations. Reuters Digital Strategy Artificial Intelligence Act 2 August 2027 Deadline for legacy models (deployed before 2 Aug 2025) to fully comply. Non-compliance beyond this date risks penalties. Digital Strategy GamingTechLaw Artificial Intelligence Act Why it matters : the EU AI Act doesn’t just impose future rules—it is already shaping model design and governance. This timeline enables innovation while maintaining protections, and it sets a global benchmark in AI ethical oversight. IMPLICATIONS FOR GLOBAL AI GOVERNANCE While the Code is EU-centric, its influence could ripple across global AI policy debates. Similar to how the GDPR became the de facto global privacy standard, the GPAI Code of Practice may evolve into a template for trustworthy AI governance especially in jurisdictions where regulatory approaches remain fragmented or inconsistent. By offering a concrete blueprint for ethical AI development , the EU is placing human rights, transparency, and democratic accountability at the heart of its AI future a move that will likely inspire emulation and adaptation globally. THE ROAD AHEAD: VOLUNTARY TODAY, ESSENTIAL TOMORROW? While the Code is currently non-binding, it may not remain so. There’s growing speculation that future amendments to the AI Act could draw on lessons from the Code to establish mandatory baseline standards — particularly if voluntary adherence proves insufficient or inconsistent. For responsible developers, however, the message is clear: adhere early, adapt proactively, and build AI that respects human values .

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "NO STOP-THE-CLOCK”: EU SAYS NO DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION OF EU AI ACT (07.07.25)", "url": "https://justai.in/8326-2/", "raw_text": "“I’ve seen, indeed, a lot of reporting, a lot of letters and a lot of things being said on the AI Act. Let me be as clear: there is no stop the clock, there is no grace period, there is no pause.” — European Commission spokesperson, Thomas Regnier July 4, 2025 On July 4, 2025 the Commission categorically rejected demands from major tech firms such as Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI to halt or postpone key provisions of its landmark AI regulation. This development underscores the EU’s unwavering commitment to its risk-based framework for AI, designed to uphold transparency, accountability, and fundamental rights, even as the world’s most powerful technology companies attempt to influence the pace and direction of regulation. THE CONTEXT: LOBBYING BY BIG TECH In recent months, major U.S.-based tech companies have amplified their lobbying efforts, urging Brussels to delay the application of certain obligations under the AI Act, which was formally adopted earlier this year. These companies argued that implementing the rules too soon, especially for General Purpose AI (GPAI) models would result in fragmented compliance efforts, potential innovation bottlenecks, and excessive regulatory burdens. In an open letter dated June 25, 2025 , signatories including Meta, Google DeepMind, and Microsoft claimed that without a “stop-the-clock” measure, the law would pose “unworkable” obligations, especially regarding foundational model transparency and documentation. They sought a temporary pause to align on technical implementation and compliance procedures, warning that rushing ahead could stifle AI advancement in Europe and disadvantage global competitiveness. But the European Commission didn’t budge. BRUSSELS’ RESPONSE: “NO PAUSE, NO DELAY” On July 4 , a spokesperson for the European Commission decisively ruled out any such pause. “Let me be as clear as possible,” she stated during a press briefing in Brussels. “There is no stop-the-clock. The AI Act is EU law and we will implement it as agreed.” This rebuttal comes not only as a signal of the Commission’s resolve but also as a message to global actors: the democratic institutions NOT CORPORATIONS will dictate the pace and principles of AI governance in Europe. The Commission clarified that the AI Office is fully operational and working to ensure the law’s phased rollout proceeds without disruption. It also emphasized that transitional timelines are already embedded within the law companies have 12 months from its entry into force in July 2024 to comply with GPAI-specific obligations , with additional deadlines stretching up to 24 months for certain high-risk systems. In essence, the EU believes it has already provided enough breathing room. WHY THIS MOMENT MATTERS? This moment marks a critical juncture in the global tech-policy power dynamic. It is not merely a case of regulatory stubbornness; it is an affirmation that lawmaking in a democracy must not be derailed by corporate pressure, especially when human rights, safety, and fairness are at stake. At the heart of the AI Act lies a framework that classifies AI systems based on risk, ranging from minimal risk (such as spam filters) to unacceptable risk (like social scoring). The most contested provisions apply to General Purpose AI and Foundation Models, particularly around data governance, transparency, and systemic risk management. These are precisely the kinds of models being deployed rapidly by Big Tech firms, often without sufficient public scrutiny or safeguards. The concerns of industry players are not trivial. Implementing compliance protocols for large-scale, black-box AI systems is undoubtedly complex. But it is precisely this complexity and the asymmetry of power and knowledge between developers and users that necessitates public accountability. In this regard, the EU’s position sends a clear normative message: Regulation is not the enemy of innovation; unregulated innovation is the enemy of democratic governance. INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS: A DOMINO EFFECT? By rejecting the pause, the EU is not only reaffirming its own legal authority but also setting a precedent for other jurisdictions. Countries like Canada, Brazil, and India currently mulling their own AI regulatory regimes, will be watching closely. The tech industry has long favored “soft regulation” and voluntary commitments, such as those facilitated by the OECD or the White House’s AI Safety Institutes. But the EU’s insistence on hard law, democratic scrutiny, and legal enforceability reflects a more grounded philosophy: that rights protection cannot be outsourced to corporate goodwill. It is worth noting that earlier in 2024, the EU engaged stakeholders in detailed consultations, with the final law reflecting a balance between technical feasibility and public interest. The demand to delay enforcement at this late stage thus raises broader questions about the sincerity of industry participation in that legislative process. WHAT’S NEXT? The AI Office, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act, is currently preparing detailed guidelines and templates to assist companies in meeting their obligations. Meanwhile, companies that develop or deploy AI models in the EU must now fast-track their compliance strategies—building documentation processes, instituting human oversight mechanisms, and assessing systemic risks. While challenges will inevitably arise, the refusal to pause signals a regulatory environment that is finally catching up to the pace of AI development. For legal scholars and ethicists, this is a rare instance where legislative foresight appears to have outrun corporate delay tactics. FINAL THOUGHTS July 4, 2025, will likely be remembered as the day the European Union drew a line in the sand. Amid global anxieties over AI’s rapid expansion from algorithmic discrimination to deepfakes and misinformation—the EU’s stance reinforces the idea that digital transformation must proceed within a rights-respecting framework. The Commission’s refusal to yield to Big Tech pressure should be viewed not as an act of defiance but as an affirmation of democratic resilience. In a world where technological evolution often outpaces law, the EU has made a bold claim: the rule of law must not be paused.

A new copyright reform proposed in June 2025 seeks to address the growing threat of synthetic media by creating legal protections that treat a person’s physical identity as property. This shift comes amid increasing concern over how generative AI is being used to imitate real people without consent, often for misinformation, harassment, or exploitation. The proposal has received cross-party support and is expected to reshape how platforms, performers, and the public engage with AI-generated content online. THE NEW LAW AT A GLANCE Personal “Imitation Protection” : Citizens would gain legal rights to their own physical appearance, voice, and identity traits—protecting against nonconsensual AI-generated simulations. Artistic and Performance Rights : Performing artists receive protection from AI-generated content that mimics their performances—spanning beyond typical copyright thresholds. Legal Enforcement : Individuals could request removal of deepfake content and seek civil compensation under Danish law. Meanwhile, platforms failing to comply face “severe fines” , possibly enforced through the EU’s Digital Services Act. Parody and Satire Exemptions : The law explicitly protects artistic expressions like parody and satire to preserve freedom of speech. WHY THIS LEGISLATION MATTERS? 1.Responds to AI’s creative overreach – With AI tools capable of mimicking facial expressions and voice with startling realism, deepfakes are contributing to misinformation, reputational damage, harassment, and identity theft. Denmark’s legislation takes a pre‑emptive approach rather than reacting to specific harms. 2. Reframing digital identity as personal property – By framing the human likeness as copyrightable, Denmark positions the body, voice, and image as legal assets, granting individuals direct legal standing. This reframing shifts the debate from data control to identity sovereignty. 3. Platform liability now stronger – Rather than relying on voluntary takedowns, platforms operating in Denmark will be legally obligated to remove unauthorized deepfakes—or face fines and EU-level consequences. 4. Sets a European precedent Denmark’s upcoming EU presidency provides a platform to promote this approach across the continent. This law may inspire broader reforms aligning with the EU AI Act and Digital Services Act. LEGISLATIVE TIMELINE Consultation : Denmark will submit the draft amendment for public consultation before its summer recess. Debate and Passage : Expected in late 2025 or early 2026 . Enforcement Begins : Likely in the fall of 2025, with full alignment under EU regulations by early 2026. BROADER GLOBAL CONTEXT While Denmark’s approach is groundbreaking in scope, other regions have enacted narrower—but growing—legal protections: United States : Legislation such as the Take it Down Act criminalizes non‑consensual deepfakes, especially those of minors, and enforces rapid removal obligations. Regional US laws : States like Tennessee passed the ELVIS Act to regulate voice cloning and simulation. Current EU AI Act (in force since 2024) mandates transparency obligations for generative AI, but lacks explicit identity‑centric protections. Denmark’s amendment may fill that legal gap. ETHICAL & PRACTICAL REFLECTIONS Empowerment through consent : Individuals retain agency over how their likeness is used, revoking consent as needed. Potential enforcement challenges : Critics warn that without fast and fair mechanisms, enforcement may be slow or burdensome—limiting the law’s efficacy. Balancing speech and privacy : Exempting satire is essential, but drawing the line between parody and harmful deepfakes may prove legally complex. Civil courts will likely decide on a case-by-case basis, balancing identity rights and freedom of expression. Global implications : As deepfake capabilities continue to grow, the notion of copyright-managed identity could become a model for other countries—and platforms. FINAL THOUGHTS As AI capabilities escalate, Denmark’s deepfake legislation is a bold, ethically minded attempt to recenter the individual in the AI age . By granting citizens a legal shield over their own image, voice, and identity, and insisting that platforms bear responsibility for unauthorized use. Denmark redefines digital rights for the 21st century. This initiative stands as a testament to responsible, rights-focused AI policy that other governments and advocates will surely watch closely.

The ban was originally included in H.R. 1, a wide-ranging tax-and-spending bill supported by President Donald Trump. But after pushback from state leaders, civil society groups, and privacy advocates, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R–Tennessee) introduced an amendment to strike it out. The Senate agreed, with only Senator Thom Tillis (R–North Carolina) voting against the change. Later that day, the Senate passed the full bill by a 51–50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance casting the deciding vote. The rest of the bill remains intact, but the AI regulation ban is gone . WHAT JUST HAPPENED? The controversial AI provision in question sought to ban states and local governments from making or enforcing their own AI-related laws for 10 years. It was quietly included in the original version of H.R. 1—colloquially called the “One Big Beautiful Bill”, but drew criticism from across the political spectrum. It also tied this ban to federal funding—meaning states would have had to give up money for broadband and tech infrastructure if they chose to regulate AI on their own. On July 1, Senator Marsha Blackburn (R–TN) formally introduced an amendment to strike the moratorium from the bill. The amendment passed overwhelmingly, 99–1, with Senator Thom Tillis (R–NC) casting the lone dissenting vote. Shortly thereafter, the broader bill itself passed the Senate 51–50, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, preserving key provisions on federal AI investment, broadband access, and tech competitiveness, minus the state regulation ban. WHY DID THE AI MORATORIUM FAIL? The proposed moratorium had been heavily backed by major tech firms, including Meta, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI. Industry leaders argued that a patchwork of inconsistent state regulations would create operational chaos, legal uncertainty, and hinder the U.S.’s ability to compete with AI developments in China and the EU. The proposal received strong opposition from many sides: State governors , including several Republicans, said the ban would take away their right to protect residents from AI harms like bias in hiring, deepfakes, or facial recognition abuse. Civil rights groups warned it would weaken efforts to fight AI-driven discrimination or privacy violations. Lawmakers from both parties said it would give too much power to the federal government and Big Tech while ignoring real risks that communities face. Senator Blackburn, who once supported the idea of a shorter five-year ban, ultimately said she could not support the moratorium without stronger protections for children and consumers. Her amendment to remove the ban passed almost unanimously. WHAT ARE STATES DOING WITH THAT POWER? Several states had been gearing up to introduce or expand their AI regulations prior to the federal vote. For example: California proposed legislation requiring AI systems to disclose training data and undergo bias audits. Illinois, with its long-standing Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), was looking to expand rules to include generative AI surveillance. New York, Connecticut, and Washington were drafting bills aimed at regulating the use of AI in employment decisions and political communications. This means the U.S. could soon see a variety of AI laws across different states , each responding to local concerns. LEGAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS This development reinforces the Tenth Amendment-based principle that unless expressly preempted, states retain the authority to regulate technologies in areas like consumer protection, education, and civil rights. However, it also creates regulatory fragmentation. AI companies must now prepare to comply with varying laws across multiple states some of which may impose stricter requirements than others. Legal scholars have pointed out that future lawsuits could arise over whether eventual federal AI laws will preempt these state-level efforts. The Senate vote also raises big questions for federal AI strategy: Will Congress move toward a comprehensive federal AI regulation to unify standards? Can the government balance innovation and rights-based protections without stifling technological growth? Will other federal efforts, such as the proposed Kids Online Safety Act, provide the missing guardrails? WHAT’S NEXT? The House of Representatives now needs to agree on the final version of the bill. It’s possible that some lawmakers may try to bring the AI moratorium back—but with such strong opposition in the Senate, that seems unlikely. Going forward, there’s still a big question: Will the federal government create a nationwide AI law that sets clear standards across all states? For now, the answer is NO. So, each state will continue to act on its own—which some see as a win for democracy, and others worry could make things messy for companies trying to follow the rules. FINAL THOUGHTS In the escalating contest over AI governance, the Senate’s vote represents a meaningful pivot toward decentralized, democratic oversight. It reaffirms the idea that states have a right to lead where Congress delays, and that the public interest must not be overridden by the interests of a few large firms. Whether this moment marks the beginning of a more balanced AI regulatory futureor just a brief pause in Washington’s deregulatory momentum remains to be seen.

The move comes amid growing concerns over data sovereignty and user privacy in the era of generative AI. Kamp accuses DeepSeek of engaging in the “illegal” transfer of German users’ personal data to servers located in China- a jurisdiction where EU-level protections under GDPR do not apply. This marks one of the most assertive actions yet by a European regulator in pushing back against non-compliant foreign AI platforms. What’s the concern? User data sent to China – According to DeepSeek’s privacy policy, everything from AI interaction logs to uploaded files is stored on Chinese servers. No proof of safeguards – Kamp reports that DeepSeek failed a May deadline to demonstrate that its data-handling matched EU standards; they did not respond. Regulator worries – Under GDPR and the EU Digital Services Act, transferring personal data without adequate guarantees is illegal. The fear: Chinese authorities might gain broad access to that data. A broader wave of restrictions Germany isn’t alone. Around the globe many countries have imposed restrictions including: Italy has already barred the app from its app stores; The Netherlands banned government use; Australia , Taiwan , South Korea , and Canada have restricted it on official devices; US lawmakers are now targeting the app for potential federal bans. DeepSeek: From hot new rival to data red flag Since its January debut, Beijing-backed DeepSeek dazzled the world with an AI model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT—delivered at a fraction of the cost. It funneled across app store charts and stoked a tech stock shake-up. But the risks quickly outpaced the hype as a Wiz Research data breach earlier this year exposed backend data—chat logs, API keys, internal metadata sparking alarm among privacy watchdogs and other nations followed suit, citing fears of censorship, data misuse, surveillance, and under the DSA, “illegal content” transmission. So what happens next? Apple and Google now face the regulatory pressure to comply. No timetable has been specified, but precedent suggests swift action in Germany’s strict data climate. DeepSeek’s response has been silence. It’s unclear whether they’ll comply, appeal, or withdraw voluntarily. EU-wide implications : Observers believe Germany’s move could spark a bloc-wide ban, echoing Italy’s lead. Final Take DeepSeek’s meteoric rise demonstrates how fast innovation can encounter fierce scrutiny—especially when state-backed players are involved. Its challenge now: either establish robust legal protections for EU data flows, or risk full-blown exclusion from vital Western markets. Regardless of technical prowess, data sovereignty and trust are becoming non-negotiable in AI’s global race.

The complaint accused Meta of copying books from “shadow libraries” to train its LLaMA AI model. Plaintiffs and Their Allegations The suit, initiated in 2023, accused Meta of unauthorized mass copying to develop its language model, including works from digital repositories like LibGen without payment or permission. The authors argued this amounted to “historically unprecedented pirating” damaging their livelihoods. Judicial Ruling: Formal Defeat—but with Caveats U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that the plaintiffs’ arguments were legally insufficient to proceed, but emphasized this did not establish that Meta’s actions were lawful. Rather, the case failed on its legal framing. “This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials… is lawful… It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments.” Judge Chhabria even hinted that future lawsuits could succeed if better argued, noting the limited scope of this decision—it was not a class action. Fair Use: Meta’s Defense Meta invoked the U.S. “fair use” doctrine, arguing that replication of works is permissible when used to create a fundamentally new product. They maintained that LLaMA doesn’t reproduce the texts and that no one uses it as a substitute for reading the original works. Implications for the AI Landscape This judgment is the second this week in the same courthouse touching on AI copyright. Another judge ruled in Anthropic’s favor but still pointed to potential liability, particularly due to pirated book sourcing. These decisions suggest a divided judiciary on how far “fair use” extends in generative AI training. Judge Chhabria also criticized tech claims that copyright compliance would stifle innovation: “These products … will generate billions, even trillions … If … necessary … they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders.” Internal Revelations: LibGen, Warnings, and Zuckerberg Unsealed court records revealed Meta’s internal debates over using LibGen, with employees expressing concerns about legality. It was later claimed that Mark Zuckerberg personally approved the use of the dataset. These documents cast doubt on Meta’s “innocent intent” narrative and put future public and regulatory scrutiny in sharper focus. What’s Next? While this ruling falls short as a legal loss for Meta, it doesn’t resolve the broader debate on AI training practices. The judge’s invitation for better‑constructed suits may embolden more authors to come forward. As AI becomes central to major tech strategies, we’re likely to see more cases testing the boundaries of copyright, transformation, and compensation. Final Thoughts For authors and rights holders: The judgment is not the final word—it spotlights a path for future, more robust legal strategies. For AI developers: Fair use remains a defensible strategy, but risk persists if commercial models rely on illegally obtained datasets. For regulators: The ruling underscores an urgent need for clearer legislation—potentially setting licensing standards rather than depending on inconsistent court outcomes.

The law, approved by the National Assembly on June 14, 2025 , is set to take effect on January 1, 2026 , and aims to position Vietnam as a global leader in technology innovation, AI development, and digital sovereignty. What’s in the Law? The Law on Digital Technology Industry outlines a comprehensive framework for promoting innovation, regulating AI, encouraging foreign investment, and developing a self-sufficient digital economy. It introduces mechanisms to: Boost domestic innovation through tax incentives, funding support, and government-backed infrastructure for tech startups and SMEs. Strengthen the local digital workforce , with the goal of fostering 150,000 digital tech enterprises by 2035. Attract international talent and capital , offering visa waivers and tax relief to digital experts and foreign firms. Regulate emerging technologies , including AI, semiconductors, and digital assets like cryptocurrencies. Ensure ethical technology development , particularly by mandating human oversight in AI systems and aligning with international standards like those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Why It Matters? In a world increasingly defined by digital capability and cyber competition, Vietnam’s approach is bold. Rather than relying on fragmented, reactive policies, the country has opted for a proactive and strategic legal foundation. Unlike Western nations that often separate data protection, AI governance, and crypto regulation into different frameworks, Vietnam’s new law consolidates all major digital domains into a single legal instrument . This is a clear signal: Vietnam is not just participating in the digital economy rather it intends to shape it. Vietnam’s Bet on “Digital Sovereignty” Vietnam’s digital law also reflects a rising trend among emerging economies to assert technological sovereignty . The emphasis on “Make in Vietnam” policies, domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and AI infrastructure suggests a desire to reduce dependence on foreign technology giants and data governance systems. It’s a notable divergence from the Silicon Valley-centric model that has dominated tech policy over the past two decades. The Global Context While the European Union’s AI Act and South Korea’s AI ethics charter have drawn international headlines, neither country has passed a unified legal framework that spans AI, digital infrastructure, talent mobility, and industry incentives. As global debates around AI safety, digital ethics, and algorithmic accountability heat up, Vietnam’s legislation offers a new model for how states—especially those in the Global South—can chart their own course. What Comes Next? The law will be officially enforced starting January 1, 2026. In the interim, the Vietnamese government will roll out detailed implementing decrees and guidelines , including criteria for AI classification, digital asset licensing, and tech investment incentives. Businesses, regulators, and digital entrepreneurs across Southeast Asia and beyond will be watching closely. Thus, in passing the world’s first law solely focused on the digital technology industry, Vietnam has made more than just a policy move. It has declared its intention to be a digital power in its own right. And as the global race for AI and digital infrastructure leadership accelerates, the rest of the world would do well to take note. References: Tuổi Trẻ News. (2025, June 14).

Gavai Warns Against Overreliance on Artificial Intelligence in Courts", "url": "https://justai.in/8268-2/", "raw_text": "Introduction: A Thoughtful Warning from the Chief Justice In a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life, including our legal systems, Chief Justice of India (CJI) Justice B.R. Gavai have expressed caution over its unchecked use. Recently, Justice Gavai, while speaking at an international legal gathering at the University of Cambridge, emphasized the importance of using AI carefully in courts. His main message was simple yet powerful—let AI be a tool for efficiency, but never let it replace the human role in delivering justice. AI in Courts: Progress So Far India’s judiciary has been making significant strides in technology adoption. From virtual court hearings during the COVID-19 pandemic to the launch of the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) and e-Courts services, technology has made courts more accessible. Innovations like the Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software (SUVAS), which translates judgments into regional languages, and Artificial Intelligence tools that help with case management, have been game-changers. Justice Gavai acknowledged this progress. He said that technology has already helped courts reach citizens more effectively, manage case backlogs, and make the system faster. But he also reminded everyone that while the use of such tools is important, we must not cross the line where machines begin to make decisions. Why AI Cannot Replace Judges At the core of Justice Gavai’s argument is the belief that justice is more than just a decision—it is a human experience. A court’s judgment often requires compassion, understanding, context, and emotional intelligence—qualities that machines do not possess. He stated that although AI tools can analyze vast amounts of data and suggest outcomes based on patterns, they cannot understand the emotional or moral aspects of a case. For example, a machine might treat all similar cases in the same way, but a judge can take into account a person’s background, intention, or mental state elements crucial to fair justice. Justice Gavai warned that allowing AI to take over judicial decisions could create a system where justice is mechanical and impersonal, which would be dangerous for a democracy. Bias in Algorithms: A Serious Concern Another major concern Justice Gavai raised was bias in AI systems. AI tools are trained on past data, and if that data includes discrimination or historical injustice, then the AI will likely repeat those same biases. He gave examples from other parts of the world where facial recognition tools used by law enforcement showed racial bias. In the U.S., for instance, facial recognition technology has been shown to wrongly identify people of color more frequently than white individuals. If such flawed systems are introduced into the Indian judicial process without safeguards, it could harm people instead of helping them. Hence, he urged the legal community and technologists to work together to build AI tools that are fair, transparent, and accountable. Safeguarding Privacy in the Digital Age Justice Gavai also spoke about the importance of protecting personal information. As courts use more digital tools, a large amount of sensitive data—like personal details, case files, and testimonies—is stored online. If not properly protected, this information can be leaked or misused. He called for strict data protection policies and urged developers to design systems that ensure high levels of security. With the rollout of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 in India, there is now a legal framework in place, but its implementation within judicial infrastructure needs close attention. Digital Divide: Inclusion Remains a Challenge Another issue he pointed out was the digital divide —the gap between those who have access to technology and those who don’t. While urban lawyers and litigants may find it easier to attend virtual hearings or file documents online, many in rural areas still lack basic internet or digital literacy. Without inclusive planning, these people risk being left out of the justice system. Justice Gavai emphasized that while embracing technology, the judiciary must also ensure that no one is left behind. Technology as a Partner, Not a Master To sum up, Justice Gavai said that AI and automation must be seen as assistants to human judges, not as replacements. He said: “A judge must always have the final say. AI can support the process, but it must never drive the decision.” This clear stance is in line with earlier views expressed by other top judges in India, including CJI Chandrachud, who has also spoken about the ethical and constitutional risks of relying too much on automated systems. Conclusion: A Balanced Way Forward The speech by Justice Gavai comes at a crucial time when courts around the world are exploring how to use AI for better justice delivery. His message is a timely reminder that technology should serve justice, not override it. India is leading in many areas of legal tech innovation, but it must now lead responsibly. With balanced use of AI, strong legal safeguards, and a human-centered approach, the Indian judiciary can continue to modernize while staying true to its core duty: to deliver fair, compassionate, and accessible justice for all.

This comes in the wake of multiple recent incidents where barristers and solicitors have unknowingly or carelessly included fabricated cases in their legal filings, produced by AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and other generative language models. The issue isn’t new. But its frequency, coupled with the high-stakes context of legal proceedings, has turned it into a growing concern for judicial authorities. The UK High Court’s latest intervention isn’t just a procedural correction—it’s a pivotal moment in the global conversation about the responsible use of artificial intelligence in legal practice. UK Judges Draw a Line: Legal Citations Must Be Human-Verified, Not AI-Fabricated Lord Justice Birss, a senior judge of the Court of Appeal and deputy head of civil justice in England and Wales, made the situation crystal clear: while AI has its utility, its misuse is already endangering the integrity of legal proceedings. Birss underscored that lawyers must personally verify the accuracy and existence of every case they cite, irrespective of how “convincing” the AI-generated reference may appear. “Submitting fictional authorities is a breach of professional duty,” Birss noted, adding that ignorance about the AI’s limitations is no longer a valid excuse. The judiciary is now urging all legal professionals to treat AI tools with the same caution they would apply to unverified sources on the internet—or risk sanctions including reprimands, fines, and possible referral to regulatory bodies. When AI Becomes a Liability: The Danger of “Hallucinated” Legal Precedents At the heart of this issue is a phenomenon now widely known as “AI hallucination”—where large language models generate content that is grammatically plausible, contextually relevant, but entirely fabricated. For the average user, this might mean a bogus Shakespeare quote or a made-up scientific fact. In a courtroom, however, it could mean the wrongful direction of a case or even a miscarriage of justice. Legal AI tools, often designed to summarize, draft, or suggest precedents, can mimic the language and formatting of genuine case law so well that even seasoned lawyers are occasionally duped. The problem? These tools don’t actually “know” anything —they predict text based on patterns, not facts or verifiable databases. This raises troubling questions: Should lawyers rely on these tools at all for legal citations? Where does responsibility lie—in the hands of the developer, or the user? The UK Is Not Alone: World Ripples of AI Misuse in Law What makes the UK High Court’s warning particularly noteworthy is its timing. In recent months, similar incidents have been reported in the United States, India, and parts of Europe. One infamous case last year involved a New York attorney who cited several non-existent cases generated by ChatGPT—resulting in public backlash and professional embarrassment. India’s judiciary, too, is grappling with how to integrate AI into its notoriously overburdened system while avoiding the pitfalls of overreliance. With the rollout of digitized filing systems, there’s been a quiet but growing use of AI summarization tools and draft generators—tools that, if left unchecked, could lead to similar ethical breaches. Ethical Advocacy in the Age of AI As a researcher working on the responsible adoption of AI in law, this incident in the UK reaffirms a growing thesis: technology is only as ethical as the people and systems that deploy it . The legal profession—unlike many other fields—is built on precedent, trust, and rigorous documentation. Introducing tools that can hallucinate, mislead, or fabricate erodes these foundational principles. This is not a call to abandon AI; rather, it’s a call to rethink its governance, improve transparency , and build better AI literacy among legal practitioners. AI’s power lies in its efficiency, but it is not a replacement for human judgment. Lawyers need to view these tools as assistants , not advisors . The distinction is critical. So, What Needs to Happen Now? Mandatory AI Literacy Training: Law schools and bar associations must introduce structured courses on AI tools, their limitations, and ethical use cases. AI Use Disclosures in Filings: Courts could require that any AI-assisted work be disclosed in legal documents, similar to conflict-of-interest declarations. Stronger Penalties for AI Misuse: Sanctions must not only be punitive but also educational—such as mandatory retraining or suspension from practice. Ethical AI Product Design: Tech companies creating legal AI tools need to embed disclaimers, verification prompts, and red-flag systems when generating citations or legal content. Cross-Jurisdictional Dialogue: Given the global nature of AI, legal systems across countries must collaborate on setting standards for AI use in legal procedures. A Crossroads of Law and Technology The UK court’s warning is more than a local disciplinary moment—it is a wake-up call for the global legal community . As AI becomes increasingly embedded in legal research, writing, and decision-making, we must ask the hard questions now. What role do we want AI to play in the justice system? And how do we ensure that it enhances, rather than undermines, the pursuit of truth? The rule of law depends on verifiability, responsibility, and integrity. If we allow unverified, AI-generated hallucinations to infiltrate our courtrooms, we risk replacing the pursuit of justice with the illusion of it. As we stand on the brink of widespread AI adoption in courts, the message is clear: Use AI responsibly—or risk being overruled by your own tools.

JAPAN THINK SO, AND THEY’VE GOT A LAW TO PROVE IT (05.06.2025)", "url": "https://justai.in/can-you-innovate-without-breaking-rules-japan-think-so-and-theyve-got-a-law-to-prove-it-05-06-2025/", "raw_text": "In a world where artificial intelligence is outpacing regulation and headlines are dominated by lawsuits, misinformation, and rogue AI tools, Japan has taken a bold, and arguably a refreshing step. On May 28, 2025, the Japanese Parliament passed its first-ever law dedicated solely to Artificial Intelligence. But unlike Europe’s hardline AI Act or the United States’ still-fragmented approach, Japan isn’t swinging a regulatory hammer. Instead, it’s striking a calculated balance: foster innovation, yes, but not at the cost of human rights, accountability, or ethical oversight. Framed around transparency and soft enforcement, the law empowers authorities to investigate AI misuse and publicly name violators, signaling a shift from voluntary guidelines to formal guardrails. While critics call it “toothless” without criminal penalties, others see it as Japan’s strategic play to become a global AI leader without alienating its citizens or its startups. The Genesis of Japan’s AI Legislation On May 28, 2025, Japan’s Parliament passed a bill establishing a legal framework to promote AI development and mitigate associated risks. The legislation received bipartisan support, underscoring a national consensus on the importance of responsible AI integration into society. The law empowers the government to investigate AI-related incidents that infringe upon citizens’ rights and interests. In cases of serious violations, authorities can advise and instruct implicated businesses and disclose their names to the public. Notably, the law refrains from imposing criminal penalties, opting instead for a “name and shame” approach to encourage compliance without stifling innovation. Key Provisions and Regulatory Mechanisms The legislation introduces several critical components: Designation of AI Developers : Entities developing specific AI infrastructure models must notify competent authorities and establish systems to ensure the safety of AI development. Compliance Reporting : Designated developers are required to periodically report their compliance status, subject to government audits and potential corrective measures. Public Disclosure : In instances of AI misuse leading to human rights violations or other malicious activities, the government can publicly disclose the names of responsible businesses. Strategic AI Team : A dedicated team comprising Cabinet ministers will draft a basic policy on AI to strengthen Japan’s competitiveness in the field. International Collaboration and Ethical Commitments Japan’s AI legislation aligns with its commitment to international cooperation on AI governance. In February 2025, Japan signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law, becoming one of the first non-European countries to do so. This treaty underscores Japan’s dedication to upholding fundamental values in AI development and complements domestic efforts to create an innovation-friendly yet ethically grounded AI ecosystem. Addressing Privacy and Data Utilization Recognizing the importance of data in AI development, Japan is considering amendments to its privacy laws to facilitate the use of personal information in AI training, particularly in healthcare. Proposals include easing consent requirements for collecting sensitive data, provided it is anonymized and used solely for AI development purposes. Legal experts, such as Takashi Nakazaki and Takafumi Ochiai, are advising the government on establishing standardized data-sharing frameworks that balance innovation with privacy protection. Implications for AI Developers and Businesses The new law signals a shift from voluntary guidelines to enforceable regulations, emphasizing accountability in AI development. While the absence of criminal penalties may raise concerns about enforcement efficacy, the reputational risks associated with public disclosure serve as a deterrent against AI misuse. Businesses operating in Japan must now navigate a more structured regulatory environment, ensuring compliance with safety standards and ethical considerations in AI deployment. Conclusion Japan’s AI legislation represents a significant step toward responsible AI governance, balancing the imperatives of innovation and ethical integrity.

DELHI HIGH COURT SAYS ‘NO’ TO AI-GENERATED LIES ABOUT SADHGURU (03.05.2025)", "url": "https://justai.in/can-you-trust-what-you-see-online-delhi-high-court-says-no-to-ai-generated-lies-about-sadhguru-03-05-2025/", "raw_text": "In a decisive ruling that highlights the rising legal tension around deepfake technology and personal rights, the Delhi High Court ordered the removal of doctored AI-generated content that misused the name and likeness of renowned spiritual leader Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev. The court’s interim order comes in response to a plea filed by the Isha Foundation, alleging that manipulated media featuring Sadhguru was being used to propagate scams and mislead the public. The Court’s Directive: A Digital Detox for Deceptive Content Justice Neena Bansal Krishna, presiding over the matter, instructed social media platforms, websites, and search engines to take down or disable access to the manipulated visuals, which included fabricated arrest videos, fake endorsements, and altered audios of Sadhguru. These AI-manipulated materials allegedly associated Sadhguru with cryptocurrency scams and false investment opportunities, exploiting his reputation to gain public trust. The court acknowledged that while freedom of expression is a constitutional right, it cannot be used as a shield to spread disinformation, particularly when it infringes on an Individual’s Personality Rights & Public Image. The order was also extended to the Indian government and intermediaries, invoking provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 , and the recently notified IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 . Legal Implications: Personality Rights Meet Generative AI This case brings into sharp focus the evolving nature of personality rights in the age of AI. Traditionally associated with celebrities, sportspersons, and public figures, these rights are now being tested against powerful generative tools capable of creating hyper-realistic synthetic content. The misuse of such content not only dilutes public trust but also raises serious concerns about data privacy, cyber fraud, and reputational damage. The Delhi High Court’s intervention is a significant development in shaping India’s jurisprudence around deepfakes and unauthorized digital impersonation. It also sets a precedent for future cases, possibly paving the way for legislative reform in this domain. India’s Larger Legal Landscape on AI: Still a Work in Progress India is still in the nascent stages of formulating robust regulatory mechanisms for AI. The recently constituted AI Copyright Committee, under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), has already run into trouble. The resignation of an appointed member over the lack of technical expertise in the committee reflects broader systemic challenges in keeping pace with the fast-moving AI ecosystem. Furthermore, legal disputes such as the one initiated by Asian News International (ANI) against OpenAI for unauthorized use of its copyrighted content reveal the growing strain between AI developers and content creators. These legal flashpoints underscore the urgency for a national AI framework that addresses not just innovation, but also rights protection, misinformation, and ethical AI development. The Way Forward: Legal Literacy, Regulatory Reform, and Technological Accountability The Delhi High Court’s ruling serves as a much-needed intervention in the face of increasing AI-driven misinformation. But isolated judicial actions are not enough. India must prioritize the development of a cohesive legal framework that governs AI-generated content, ensuring that individual rights are protected without stifling technological advancement. This would involve: Codifying protections against digital impersonation and deepfakes. Mandating transparency and watermarking in AI-generated media. Enhancing the accountability of intermediaries and content-hosting platforms. Encouraging public education on media literacy and digital hygiene. As India races ahead with its Digital India vision and AI-powered economy, these developments serve as a critical reminder: without robust legal guardrails, technology can become a double-edged sword.

(29.05.25)", "url": "https://justai.in/meta-to-restart-ai-training-on-public-content-in-europe-know-whats-at-stake-29-05-25/", "raw_text": "On May 28, 2025, Meta commenced utilizing publicly shared content from Facebook and Instagram users in Europe to train its artificial intelligence systems. This development has sparked significant discussions concerning privacy rights, consent, and the ethical use of personal data. Meta’s AI Training Initiative: An Overview Meta’s AI training now incorporates a wide array of user-generated content, including text posts, comments, photos, videos, captions, stories, reels, and activities within pages and groups. Notably, private messages and data from users under 18 are excluded from this process. However, interactions with Meta AI features, such as those within WhatsApp, may be utilized for AI training purposes. The company asserts that this approach aligns with practices adopted by other tech giants like Google and OpenAI, emphasizing that it offers more transparent and user-friendly controls compared to its counterparts. Opt-Out Mechanism and User Rights European users were notified of these changes and provided with an option to object to the use of their data for AI training. To exercise this right, users could access their account settings, navigate to the privacy policy section, and submit an objection form. However, objections submitted after the May 27 deadline only apply to future content, not past posts. Critics argue that the opt-out process is cumbersome and lacks clarity, potentially discouraging users from asserting their rights. Furthermore, even individuals without Meta accounts may have their data used if they appear in public posts shared by others. Legal and Ethical Concerns Meta’s decision has faced legal challenges and scrutiny from privacy advocates. In Germany, a consumer rights group sought to halt Meta’s data usage for AI training but was unsuccessful, as the court ruled in Meta’s favor. In Brazil, the national data protection agency suspended Meta’s plan to use user posts for AI training, citing potential violations of privacy laws, especially concerning minors. Meta was given a deadline to amend its privacy policy accordingly. These developments highlight the ongoing global debate over data privacy, user consent, and the ethical implications of using personal content for AI development. Implications for Users The integration of user-generated content into AI training raises several concerns: Privacy: Users may be unaware that their public posts are being used to train AI systems, leading to potential misuse of personal information. Consent: The opt-out model places the burden on users to prevent their data from being used, rather than requiring explicit consent. Data Security: Once data is used for AI training, it cannot be fully deleted, raising questions about long-term data storage and security. These issues underscore the need for transparent policies and robust user controls to ensure ethical AI development. Conclusion Meta’s initiative to use public Facebook and Instagram posts for AI training marks a significant step in the evolution of AI technologies. While it promises advancements in AI capabilities, it also brings to the forefront critical discussions about privacy, consent, and ethical data usage. As AI continues to integrate into various aspects of daily life, it is imperative for companies to prioritize user rights and establish clear, accessible mechanisms for data control.

Formation of the AI Copyright Committee On April 28, 2025, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), under the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, established a new committee with the objective of analyzing the legal and policy concerns arising from utilization of artificial intelligence technology in copyright matters. The key responsibility of the committee is to evaluate the competency of existing provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957, in addressing the issues by AI technology. The committee consists of legal experts, policymakers, and industry stakeholders who are given task of preparing a working paper which outlines the recommendations for potential legislative or policy changes. Member’s Withdrawal Highlights Expertise Gap A member from the committee, (chose to be anonymous), has raised apprehensions over having them included in the committee without prior consultation and expressed lack of expertise in the area of artificial intelligence. Further, the members have written a formal request to the DPIIT and requested their removal with someone who is an expert in artificial intelligence technology and given a statement that, “I am not an AI expert,” “I’ve written to DPIIT, but I haven’t received a response. I don’t understand why I was included in this committee in the first place”, shows their lack of interest and knowledge in this particular committee. This instance emphasizes upon relevance of including people with appropriate experience and interest which would intersect complex technological and legal domains. Coinciding Legal Proceedings: OpenAI vs. ANI The first meeting of the committee is scheduled for May 16, 2025, which coincides with a major judicial matter in the Delhi High Court. The case is regarding a news agency ANI who sued OpenAI, the inventor of ChatGPT, for allegedly utilizing its public content in training AI models without proper authorization. This case seems to be a major point of discussion in the committee’s meeting as it is directly concerns the intersection of AI, copyright, and legal reform. Notably, two committee members, Adarsh Ramanujan and Ameet Datta , are part of this case as amicus curiae and counsel for the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), respectively. The DNPA represents 21 media publishers, including Hindustan Times Digital. Broader Context: AI and Copyright Challenges The use of artificial intelligence technology for creating content and dissemination has raised alarming concerns worldwide about copyright infringement and the protection of intellectual property. In India, the Copyright Act, 1957 do not specifically address AI-generated works or acknowledge AI as an author. This ambiguity and vagueness in the existing legislation poses challenges in identifying authorship and ownership of AI-generated content. For instance, in a famous case, the Indian Copyright Office initially granted joint authorship to an AI tool named Raghav and its creator, Ankit Sahni , for an artwork. However, the office later issued a withdrawal notice, questioning the legal status of AI as an author and highlighting the need for legislative clarity in this domain. India’s Path Forward: Legislative Reforms and Public Consultation Recognizing the rapid advancements in AI technology and its implications for copyright law, Indian authorities are considering legislative reforms. The upcoming Digital India Bill is expected to address issues related to AI and copyright, aiming to secure the rights of content creators while fostering innovation. Experts advocate for extensive public consultation in this process to ensure that diverse perspectives are considered. Conclusion The resignation request from a member of India’s AI copyright committee highlights the complexities and challenges in aligning technological advancements with existing legal frameworks. As AI continues to evolve and permeate various aspects of content creation and dissemination, it is imperative for policymakers to engage experts across disciplines to craft informed, balanced, and forward-looking legislation. The outcome of the OpenAI vs. ANI case and the deliberations of the AI copyright committee will likely set significant precedents, shaping the future of AI governance and copyright law in India.

Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the Supreme Court has unveiled a comprehensive action plan aimed at expediting the resolution of these cases through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), digitisation, and strategic administrative reforms . The Magnitude of the Backlog The Supreme Court, in a suo motu case concerning bail for convicts with prolonged pending appeals, highlighted the staggering number of unresolved criminal appeals. The Allahabad High Court leads with approximately 2.77 lakh pending cases, followed by Madhya Pradesh (1.15 lakh), Punjab and Haryana (79,326), Rajasthan (56,455), and Bombay (28,257). Even smaller states like Chhattisgarh report over 18,000 pending cases. A significant contributor to this backlog is the acute shortage of judges. For instance, the Allahabad High Court operates with only 79 judges against a sanctioned strength of 160. This deficit hampers the timely adjudication of cases. Supreme Court’s Strategic Recommendations To address this crisis, the Supreme Court has proposed a multi-pronged strategy focusing on technological integration and administrative efficiency: Digitisation of Trial Court Records The Court emphasized the need for High Courts to automatically requisition digital copies of trial court records upon the admission of a criminal appeal. This move aims to eliminate delays caused by the manual transmission of documents. Appointment of Registrars for Case Management The creation of the post of Registrar (Court and Case Management) has been recommended to ensure that case files are prepared promptly and all procedural requirements are met before final hearings. This role is pivotal in streamlining case management processes. Utilization of AI Tools The Supreme Court has advocated for the adoption of AI tools, such as SUVAS (Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software), to facilitate the translation of legal documents. This initiative is expected to expedite the processing of cases by overcoming language barriers and enhancing accessibility. Video Conferencing for Inter-Bench Collaboration High Courts with multiple benches are encouraged to employ video conferencing, enabling benches with lighter caseloads to assist those burdened with heavier workloads. This approach aims to balance the judicial burden and improve case turnover. Prioritization of Appeals by Incarcerated Individuals The Court has underscored the importance of prioritizing appeals filed by individuals currently in custody. This measure seeks to uphold the rights of undertrial prisoners and ensure timely justice. Call for Expedited Judicial Appointments Beyond technological interventions, the Supreme Court has categorically underscored that no digital solution can substitute the urgent need to fill judicial vacancies. India’s judiciary continues to operate under-staffed, with several High Courts functioning at half or less than their sanctioned strength. In a strong rebuke, the Court has urged the Central Government to expedite the clearance and appointment of judges, highlighting the delays in the collegium recommendations’ processing. As per the Court’s observations, structural bottlenecks in the appointment process, bureaucratic delays, and political indifference have cumulatively undermined judicial efficiency. The Court’s directive echoes concerns raised repeatedly by legal experts and bar associations, who have warned that the chronic under-staffing of courts is eroding public faith in the judicial system. The Court has called for a time-bound framework for appointments, warning that continued delays would only deepen the crisis of pendency. Model Action Plan for Reduction of Arrears The Committee on Case Flow Management of the Supreme Court, under the leadership of the Chief Justice of India, has already formulated a Model Action Plan for Reduction of Arrears. This plan lays down detailed steps, including identification of long-pending cases, special benches for backlog clearance, daily cause list management, and monitoring dashboards for real-time tracking of disposals. The Supreme Court has directed all High Courts to adopt this Model Action Plan and customize it to their local needs, ensuring that the focus remains not only on clearing the existing backlog but also on institutionalizing mechanisms to prevent future pile-ups. Conclusion The Supreme Court’s proactive measures signify a transformative approach to addressing the chronic issue of case backlogs in India’s judiciary. By embracing technological advancements and streamlining administrative processes, the Court aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the justice delivery system. The successful implementation of these recommendations will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including the judiciary, executive, and legal fraternity.

(12.05.25)", "url": "https://justai.in/training-ai-on-copyrighted-work-what-does-us-copyright-office-has-to-say-12-05-25/", "raw_text": "The increasing utilisation of AI systems which are capable of producing text, imagery, audio, and video has reignited longstanding debates about copyright law’s ability to keep pace with technological innovation. In response to the challenges posed by AI to the Intellectual property principles of Authorship and Ownership, the U.S. Copyright Office released a pre‑publication report. Drawing on over 10,000 public comments and congressional inquiries, the report frames a complex debate over when AI developers must seek authorization, how fair use applies, and what licensing mechanisms might emerge. THE TECHNICAL AND COPYRIGHT FOUNDATION At its core, modern AI training entails the systematic ingestion and processing of vast “corpora” of data ranging from public‑domain texts and user‑contributed content to subscription‑only articles and proprietary visual or audio works. This multi‑stage pipeline not only underpins the generative capabilities of today’s large‑scale neural networks but also implicates multiple aspects of the reproduction right under U.S. copyright law. 1. Data Collection & Curation Acquisition Methods: Developers often rely on automated web crawlers to harvest publicly accessible material, license bulk collections from publishers, or ingest millions of user‑generated posts via APIs. Each act of copying—even if for analysis—constitutes reproduction, since the work is fixed in a new medium or storage device. Filtering and Deduplication: Proprietary filtering algorithms remove low‑quality, corrupted, or duplicate files to optimize training efficiency. However, even “temporary” duplicates stored in cache during preprocessing can trigger infringement concerns under the Transient Copying Doctrine . Metadata Tagging and Weighting: Data is often annotated with contextual metadata—author, date, genre—and re‑weighted to prioritize under‑represented domains (e.g., non‑English texts), further embedding subjective editorial decisions into the curated dataset. 2. Model Training Parameter Adjustment (“Weights”): Training involves iteratively adjusting millions or billions of internal parameters so that the model’s mathematical representation encodes statistical relationships rather than verbatim text. Yet each training cycle entails transient reproductions: as input tokens or image patches are loaded into memory, they are “fixed” momentarily in the model’s buffer, satisfying the “copy” element of infringement . Checkpointing and Fine‑Tuning: Intermediate models (“checkpoints”) are often saved to disk for later fine‑tuning on specialized sub‑corpora. These snapshots—if retained indefinitely represent additional copies of the underlying training material and may require clearance. 3. Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) Hybrid Architecture: RAG systems combine a generative backbone with an external indexed database that can be queried at inference time. When prompted, the model retrieves and incorporates verbatim passages from the index, blending generation with exact replication. Indexing Rights: Creating and maintaining a searchable index of copyrighted texts effectively duplicates the works and may exceed the scope of a fair use defense if used for commercial outputs that mirror the retrieved content. Attribution and Transparency: Some architectures log provenance metadata tracking which source documents contributed to each output to enable authorship attribution, yet the very act of logging implies storage of copies for future reference. Each of these technical steps intersects with the exclusive right of reproduction codified at 17 U.S.C. § 106. Whether developers must clear rights depends on whether these acts qualify for an exception, most prominently fair use, or whether a licensing regime (voluntary or statutory) is necessary to legitimize large‑scale AI training. The U.S. Copyright Office report thus urges stakeholders to examine not only the end‑product (the model’s outputs) but also the intermediate copying that undergirds generative AI. POINTS OF POTENTIAL INFRINGMENT The pre‑publication draft is a trove of rigorous analysis. It translates machine‑learning jargon (neural‑net “weights,” token‑by‑token generation, retrieval‑augmented architectures) into legal concepts, mapping each phase of AI training onto the reproduction right. The report quickly captures attention by spotlighting three “critical touchpoints ” in AI development that may trigger infringement claims: The mass copying of training data, Transient reproductions during model optimization, and Model outputs that echo specific copyrighted passages. FAIR USE AS THE DEFAULT US FRAMEWORK It weighs the four fair‑use factors with surgical precision, examining: Purpose and Transformativeness. Does ingesting copyrighted text as statistical data create something “new,” or merely replicate the original author’s labor? Nature of the Source Material. How should courts balance the higher creative value of novels and films against the empirical needs of AI research? Amount and Necessity. Is wholesale copying of entire works “reasonable” when partial or abstracted datasets might suffice? Market Harm. Will AI‑powered substitutes undermine licensing revenues or spawn new licensing markets that enrich creators? By unpacking each factor with real‑world vignettes from a language model trained on bestselling novels to an image generator fed millions of professional photographs, the report anticipates how courts may navigate literary disputes. LICENSING AS A WAY FORWARD To mitigate fair use’s unpredictability, the report outlines three complementary licensing pathways: Voluntary Collective Licensing: Rights holders form consortia that grant blanket permissions under uniform terms. This “one‑stop shop” reduces individual negotiations and pools revenues, but only covers participating creators and requires robust governance to allocate fees equitably. Statutory Compulsory Licenses: Legislation mandates AI‑training rights in exchange for preset royalties, with an opt‑out registry for dissenting authors. This model delivers legal certainty and includes orphan works, but must align with international treaty obligations and entails significant administrative overhead. Extended Collective Licensing (ECL): Building on voluntary agreements, ECL automatically extends deals to all works in defined categories unless specifically excluded. It combines wide coverage with negotiated terms but may face resistance from creators wary of reduced individual control and poses cross‑border enforcement challenges. Each approach balances inclusivity, certainty, and administrative feasibility differently—suggesting that a hybrid mix of collective market mechanisms and targeted statutory measures may ultimately best serve both AI innovators and content creators. COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE: USA V EU In the United States , the Copyright Office relies chiefly on an expansive, case‑by‑case fair use framework emphasizing a nuanced balancing of the four statutory factors to accommodate both cutting‑edge AI innovation and the rights of authors. By contrast, the European Union generally treats the use of copyrighted works for AI training under its Text & Data Mining (TDM) exception in the 2019 DSM Directive (Articles 3–4), which allows computational analysis of lawfully accessed works for research and non‑commercial purposes, with an opt‑out for rights holders. Although this TDM exception broadly covers AI training, stakeholders have criticized its limits particularly its research‑oriented carve‑out and the EU AI Act’s failure to explicitly address generative AI’s commercial scale . The EU approach offers greater legal certainty through a statutory exception but may constrain commercial deployment without further legislative refinement, whereas the U.S. approach allows more flexibility (and uncertainty) via fair use determinations. IMPLICATIONS FOR INDIA As India advances its digital infrastructure and AI capabilities, the lessons from both the U.S. and EU models provide valuable direction. The U.S. approach—anchored in flexible, case-by-case fair use assessments offers room for judicial discretion but lacks the legal certainty developers and rights holders may desire. On the other hand, the EU’s Text and Data Mining (TDM) exception provides a statutory foundation with clear opt-out provisions, though it is largely research-focused and may not fully address commercial AI use cases. For India, currently governed by the Copyright Act, 1957, the absence of specific provisions on data mining or AI training highlights a regulatory gap. Moving forward, India could explore adopting a hybrid framework, one that permits AI training under a statutory exception for lawful, non-commercial uses, while also enabling voluntary collective licensing models for commercial applications. Such a model would provide clarity, protect the rights of Indian creators, and encourage innovation by AI developers, especially within India’s emerging digital economy and startup ecosystem.", "summary": "Authored by Ms. Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2025-05-12T13:28:45", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.627530", "tags": [250], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "TRAINING AI ON COPYRIGHTED WORK: WHAT DOES US COPYRIGHT OFFICE HAS TO SAY?

The report says that, majority of Indians are still unfamiliar with the technology, revealing that over 60 per cent of Indians are not familiar with AI and only 31 per cent have tried any generative AI tool . The findings were released during Google’s first-ever Gemini Day in India, held in New Delhi on Friday, April 25, 2025. The study highlights that while the global conversation around AI intensifies, India remains in the early stages of mass adoption. Survey Details and Methodology The Google-Kantar study surveyed 8,000 Indians between the ages of 18 and 44, from tier 1 and tier 2 cities . The research is based on face-to-face interviews with participants from two socioeconomic classes of households. The study was divided into two phases: Phase 1 measured awareness and adoption of AI tools among 5,133 respondents , and Phase 2 assessed the impact of Google’s Gemini on 3,415 respondents . The survey was conducted prior to the full rollout of the latest Gemini 2.5 models, and it paints a detailed picture of the current AI adoption landscape in the country. Gemini Day: Showcasing New Innovations At the event, Google demonstrated a series of cutting-edge features from the Gemini AI family. These included the Veo 2 text-to-video generator , Gemini Live with Video , Gemini Canvas , Deep Research , and Audio Overviews . Manish Gupta, Senior Director at Google DeepMind , shared insights into the progress being made in localizing AI for the Indian context. “ Gemini Live already works in nine Indian languages. Under the covers, my team has been hard at work at making it understand over 100 Indian languages. In fact, we’ve been developing benchmarks that we’ve been sharing with the community. And our benchmarks show that it is the best model bar none, when it comes to the whole range of something like 29 Indian languages, ” Gupta said. Gemini 2.5: Key Technological Advancements Highlighting the technical prowess of Gemini 2.5 , Gupta emphasized the model’s ability to handle long-form content. He explained, “ Gemini 2.5 also has advanced coding capabilities […] It can process an entire series of novels, two-hour long videos, or large code repositories and still keep track of details that are buried in that long-form content, ” underscoring the depth and flexibility of the updated model. These capabilities are expected to play a crucial role in expanding the use cases of AI in India, particularly in sectors like education, content creation, and enterprise solutions. Massive Potential for Growth The findings suggest a massive headroom for AI adoption in India. With only 31 per cent of the surveyed individuals having ever used generative AI tools, the majority of the population remains a largely untapped market. Despite the relatively low adoption rates, the impact on existing users has been overwhelmingly positive. As per the study, over 93 per cent of Gemini users reported a boost in productivity . Furthermore, 95 per cent of users said that Gemini helped spark their creativity . The report further states, “ Furthermore, 80 per cent report Gemini has helped with complex decision-making or expert guidance, 69 per cent say it supported their skill development and learning journey, and 77 per cent found it helped them pursue a new creative or professional pursuit. ” Gemini’s Growing Global Reach While the study did not specify the number of Gemini users in India, recent public reports indicate that the AI tool has amassed 350 million users globally . This marks a significant milestone for Google’s AI platform, especially given that Gemini is still trailing behind its competitors. By comparison, OpenAI’s ChatGPT reported around 600 million monthly active users (MAUs) in March 2025, and Meta AI is estimated to have about 500 million MAUs . Nevertheless, the rapid growth of Gemini highlights the increasing acceptance and curiosity surrounding AI technologies worldwide, including emerging markets like India. Future Prospects The insights presented during Gemini Day indicate a strong commitment from Google to drive AI adoption in India.

The targeted consultation aims to draw on practical experience from the field to shape forthcoming Commission guidelines. (You are invited to provide feedback on the consultation by 22 May.) Practical Experience at the Core of New AI Rules In a statement released today, the Commission stated: “Today, the Commission invites stakeholders to bring their practical experience to shape clear, accessible EU rules on general-purpose AI (GPAI) models in a targeted consultation that will contribute to the upcoming Commission guidelines.” The initiative signals the Commission’s ongoing efforts to ensure the practical applicability of the AI Act, a key legislative framework that governs the development, marketing, and deployment of AI technologies within the European Union. Stakeholders now have the opportunity to inform these rules with real-world insights and scenarios. Clarifying Core Concepts in the AI Act The upcoming guidelines will play a crucial role in interpreting the new provisions in the AI Act related to GPAI. According to the Commission, the guidelines will aim to provide “detailed explanations on questions such as ‘what is a general-purpose AI model’, ‘which entities are providers in various constellations’, and ‘which actions constitute a placing on the market’.” These clarifications are expected to address current ambiguities surrounding GPAI models and their regulatory status, especially in the wake of rapid advancements in AI capabilities and deployment. Role of the AI Office and Support for Compliance To support smooth implementation of the rules, the Commission emphasized the role of the newly established AI Office. According to the statement, the guidelines “will also lay out how the AI Office will provide support to facilitate compliance.” The AI Office is envisioned as a central supervisory body to monitor, support, and enforce provisions under the AI Act, working closely with the AI Board and national authorities. Code of Practice and Reduced Burden for Providers In a move likely to incentivize early and voluntary compliance, the Commission revealed that signing the Code of Practice could help streamline regulatory obligations for GPAI providers. The statement added that the upcoming guidelines “will explain how signing the Code of Practice – if approved by the AI Office and the AI Board – may reduce administrative burden for providers and serve as a benchmark for regulatory compliance.” This step is designed to foster greater transparency and proactive alignment with EU values among AI developers and distributors. Complementary to the Code of Practice The guidelines are set to serve as a companion to the much-anticipated Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI, which is currently under finalization. The Commission clarified: “In this respect the guidelines will complement the Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI, which is currently being finalised.” While the Code of Practice will lay down best practices for GPAI model development and use, the guidelines will provide interpretive direction on how to meet regulatory expectations. Inclusive Call for Feedback The Commission is calling on a broad spectrum of participants to contribute to the consultation process. The call explicitly invites “providers of GPAI models, downstream providers of AI systems, civil society, academia, other experts, and public authorities” to submit their perspectives. Feedback must be submitted by 22 May 2025 , giving stakeholders one month to provide their views and practical suggestions. Non-Binding But Influential Guidelines While the guidelines will not carry the force of law, they are expected to significantly influence how the AI Act is implemented and enforced across the EU. The Commission noted: “The guidelines will not be binding but provide clarification on how the Commission, responsible for supervising and enforcing the general-purpose AI rules, will interpret and apply them under the AI Act.” Such guidance will be essential for industry players seeking to avoid regulatory pitfalls and align their operations with the spirit and letter of the law. Publication Timeline Confirmed Both the guidelines and the finalized Code of Practice are slated for release ahead of August 2025. Their publication will mark a crucial phase in the full-scale application of the AI Act, particularly as general-purpose AI technologies gain momentum across public and private sectors. Further Consultations in the Pipeline The Commission also hinted at future regulatory initiatives, stating: “As part of its efforts to support stakeholders in implementing the AI Act, the Commission will also soon launch a targeted consultation on the classification of AI systems as high-risk.” This upcoming consultation will delve into another vital area of the AI Act – the identification and handling of high-risk AI systems, which are subject to stricter obligations under the regulation. What’s Next for Stakeholders With the consultation window now open, industry leaders, researchers, and public bodies are encouraged to act swiftly. Participation in this consultation represents a rare opportunity to influence the trajectory of one of the world’s most comprehensive AI regulatory frameworks before it takes full effect.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "UAE Cabinet Approves First-of-its-Kind AI Regulatory Ecosystem (April 14, 2025)", "url": "https://justai.in/uae-cabinet-approves-first-of-its-kind-ai-regulatory-ecosystem-april-14-2025/", "raw_text": "In a radical move to modernize the legal landscape, the UAE Cabinet has approved the establishment of a new Regulatory Intelligence Office supported by an AI-powered integrated regulatory intelligence ecosystem. The initiative aims to create a more agile and responsive legal system, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to track, evaluate and reform laws in real time. Real-Time Law Impact Tracking The newly approved AI ecosystem is designed to “monitor the impact of laws on the economy and society in real time ” and “ recommend updates and reforms based on data analysis. ” This advanced system will enable decision-makers to see how legislation affects people and businesses on a daily basis, marking a significant shift in how the legal process is conducted in the UAE. In a statement shared on the social media platform X, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai , wrote, “This new legislative system, powered by artificial intelligence, will change how we create laws, making the process faster and more precise.” Cabinet Decision Details The announcement came following the weekly UAE Cabinet of Ministers meeting. “Today’s weekly UAE Cabinet of Ministers meeting approved the creation of a new Regulatory Intelligence Office supported by a new AI-powered integrated regulatory intelligence ecosystem, in an initiative to create a more agile legal system,” HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum confirmed via X. The new system will feature a centralized AI-based legislative map that links all federal and local laws with court rulings, executive actions, and public services. This move aims to build a dynamic and integrated legal framework that is constantly informed by real-world data and aligned with national development goals. Legislative Speed and Precision One of the most transformative aspects of the initiative is the ability of artificial intelligence to accelerate legal reform significantly. According to the Cabinet, “AI will help accelerate the legislative process by up to 70 percent, reducing the time and effort required for research, drafting, evaluation, and enactment of laws.” By automating and streamlining legislative procedures, the new system is expected to drastically cut down the traditionally lengthy process of law-making. With big data analytics at its core, the AI infrastructure will assess the effectiveness of legislation and propose amendments promptly for Cabinet review. Integration of Legal Frameworks The Legislative Intelligence Office will serve as the nerve centre of the reform, operating under the Cabinet and supported by advanced AI infrastructure. “The Legislative Intelligence Office will integrate laws with court decisions, executive processes and public services, creating a dynamic legal framework responsive to real-world data.” Officials say that such integration is essential to making legislation more practical, adaptive and coherent across all levels of governance. The goal is to ensure that laws do not operate in isolation but are connected with the institutions that interpret and enforce them. Global Connectivity and Benchmarking Taking a global approach, the UAE’s new regulatory intelligence ecosystem will be connected to international legal research hubs. “The office will also link to global policy research centres, allowing the UAE leadership to benchmark its legislation against international standards and adopt proven models.” This international collaboration will help align the UAE’s legal system with global best practices and reinforce the country’s position as a leader in legal innovation and digital governance. A “Paradigm Shift” in Legal Reform Describing the Cabinet’s decision as a pivotal moment for the country’s governance, HH Sheikh Mohammed called the initiative a “paradigm shift.” He added that it “ensures the country’s legislative system keeps pace with rapid national development.” As the UAE continues to grow economically and technologically, its legal system is being re-engineered to be equally progressive. With data driving insights and reforms, the legal process becomes not only more efficient but also more attuned to the needs of society. Building on Prior Legal-Tech Investments The UAE judiciary is no stranger to technological innovation. Over recent years, it has introduced several AI-based applications and tools aimed at transforming legal services. “There are already a number of branches of the UAE judicial system that are introducing new AI systems and applications. However, this new move connects lawmakers directly with data and insights on the impact and effectiveness of laws.” Earlier initiatives by the Ministry of Justice include the introduction of virtual legal advisors, family law bots, and AI-supported legal services in specialized courts. Last year, the Ministry unveiled its first virtual employee, ‘Aisha,’ a generative AI capable of interacting with court users to provide case updates and procedural guidance. Strategic Edge in AI Governance The launch of the AI-powered regulatory intelligence ecosystem is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to embed artificial intelligence into government operations. “With AI expected to transform governance globally, and the government hopes that the UAE’s early investment in legal-tech will give it a strategic edge.” This strategic positioning highlights the country’s commitment to using cutting-edge technology not only to improve internal governance but also to shape global standards in AI-powered legal systems. Toward a More Accurate and Citizen-Centric Legal System The promise of the new initiative is clear. “The Legislative Intelligence Office and AI-powered integrated regulatory intelligence ecosystem promises more meaningful legislative accuracy, faster updates and more consistent alignment with the needs of citizens, businesses and public institutions.” As the UAE ushers in a new era of digital governance, this bold step in regulatory reform underscores its dedication to modernity, transparency, and responsiveness in the legal sector. The initiative is expected to set a new global benchmark for legal system agility and innovation in the age of AI.

The regulator announced on Friday that it would examine whether data from EU/EEA users was improperly used in the training of X’s generative artificial intelligence system, Grok. In a statement issued by the DPC, the inquiry will focus on “the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts posted on the X social media platform by EU/EEA users, for the purposes of training generative artificial intelligence models.” X Agrees to Limit Use of EU Data for AI The probe follows a decision by X to limit its data use practices following legal pressure from the Irish regulator. X “agreed to stop training its AI systems using personal data collected from EU users before they had the option to withdraw their consent.” The DPC noted that it ended its legal proceedings after X agreed to impose these limitations on a permanent basis. This agreement came in the aftermath of a court case last year in which the Irish regulator sought “an order to restrict X from processing the data of EU users for the purposes of developing its AI systems.” Ireland as Lead Regulator Under GDPR The DPC serves as the lead EU regulator for X due to the company’s European operations being based in Ireland. This positioning grants the regulator the authority to conduct sweeping investigations and enforce the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Under the GDPR framework, the DPC “has the power to impose fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue,” allowing for significant financial consequences in the event of non-compliance. Track Record of DPC in Sanctioning Big Tech Ireland’s privacy watchdog has already established itself as a powerful regulatory force in the tech space since it was granted sanctioning powers in 2018. The commission has imposed hefty fines on several tech giants, including Microsoft’s LinkedIn, TikTok, and Meta. The cumulative fines on Meta alone have amounted to “almost 3 billion euros,” making it one of the most heavily sanctioned companies under the GDPR. In contrast, X – known as Twitter at the time – “has not faced sanctions since the DPC fined it 450,000 euros ($511,000) in 2020,” a penalty that marked the regulator’s first action under the new data privacy regime. Political Backlash from U.S. Leaders The investigation comes amid ongoing tensions between the EU and the U.S. over the regulation of American tech companies. U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration have been vocal in criticizing the EU’s regulatory stance. Trump and his team have “described fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of taxation,” suggesting that regulatory actions may be politically motivated or financially driven. Elon Musk’s Opposition to EU Rules Elon Musk, the owner of X and a key figure in the AI and tech industry, has also taken a firm stance against European regulations. Known for his opposition to centralized control, Musk has “railed against EU regulations, mainly those imposed directly by Brussels on online content. “As the world’s richest man and a top adviser to Trump, Musk’s views carry significant weight, particularly in discussions around data privacy, content moderation, and artificial intelligence. Legal and Ethical Concerns Surrounding AI The use of publicly-accessible posts for AI training raises pressing questions about transparency, user consent, and the ethical use of data. By opening this investigation, the DPC is signalling a broader concern within the EU about how personal data is being harvested and processed by large technology companies, especially when it involves advanced systems like generative AI. This case could serve as a precedent for how regulators interpret and enforce GDPR provisions related to AI training. It also highlights the growing scrutiny that AI development practices are likely to face in the near future. A Pivotal Moment in EU Tech Oversight The DPC’s move to scrutinize X’s data practices marks a critical juncture in the enforcement of GDPR in the AI age. As more tech companies incorporate AI into their platforms, regulators across Europe may begin launching similar inquiries to ensure user rights are protected. For now, all eyes are on Ireland’s DPC as it continues to investigate the matter. Depending on its findings, X could face new sanctions or be required to implement further compliance measures to align with EU law. The outcome of this investigation could shape the future of AI governance not just in Europe, but globally.

What followed was a sharp exchange with the bench, a viral video, and a deeper debate about whether AI has any place in the courtroom. A Younger Voice, But Not a Human One Jerome Dewald, a retired man representing himself in an employment-related appeal, submitted a video to the court. The video featured a clean-cut, younger-looking man who began speaking confidently on Dewald’s behalf. But there was a catch: the man in the video wasn’t real. It was “Jim,” an avatar created with the help of an AI tool called Tavus. Within seconds, Justice Sallie Manzanet-Daniels interrupted the proceedings, asking who the person in the video was. Dewald admitted, “I generated that. That is not a real person.” The Judge Was Not Amused The reaction from the bench was immediate and blunt. Justice Manzanet-Daniels told Dewald, “I don’t appreciate being misled.” She questioned why he hadn’t disclosed this information earlier, and why he thought this approach was acceptable. “You’re not going to use this courtroom as a launch for your business,” she added, referring to Dewald’s AI legal startup. The hearing was halted on the spot. Why He Did It? In a follow-up statement and an apology letter to the court, Dewald explained that he didn’t intend to deceive anyone. He said speaking for extended periods was difficult for him and that the avatar was a way to clearly present his arguments. He also clarified that he wasn’t using the courtroom as a demo for his company. Despite his apology, the incident raised bigger questions that go beyond one man’s legal battle. Can AI Be a Lawyer? While many tech tools have found their way into legal practice—automated research, contract review, and even virtual hearings—using a computer-generated person to speak on your behalf is still way outside the norm. Legal experts have pointed out that courts rely on accountability. A person giving testimony or presenting an argument can be questioned, corrected, or even penalized. An AI avatar? Not so much. Without a clear legal framework, judges may be left guessing who is actually speaking—and whether they even exist. There’s also the concern of authenticity. Judges want to hear from the actual party in interest—especially when they’re representing themselves—not a polished AI version made to seem more articulate or convincing. How does the Interact Reacts? Once footage from the courtroom made its way online, the story quickly went viral. Many viewers were stunned, amused, or simply confused. Some applauded Dewald’s creativity; others said it bordered on disrespect. On talk shows and news segments, legal commentators weighed in. In a segment with NewsNation’s Ashleigh Banfield, analysts called it a “wake-up call” for the courts. As one guest put it, “Just because AI can do something doesn’t mean it should.” What Happens Next? This case didn’t result in any formal penalties against Dewald, but it has opened the door to discussions about what role AI should play in real-world legal systems. Should AI be allowed in courtrooms at all? If yes, under what rules? What happens if an AI-generated avatar gives misleading information or says something that wasn’t intended by the person it represents? These are questions courts may have to answer sooner than expected. Final Thoughts The incident in the New York courtroom is more than just a viral moment, it’s a sign of the times. As AI tools become more available, people will continue to test how far they can go with them. But in the legal world, where facts, identity, and accountability matter, the lines are still being drawn.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "SOUTH KOREA AI REGULATIONS", "url": "https://justai.in/south-korea-ai-regulations/", "raw_text": "South Korea has emerged as a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance, setting a benchmark for how nations can balance rapid technological innovation with ethical responsibility. The country’s approach is characterized by a well-structured regulatory framework, forward-thinking policies, and a commitment to embedding ethical principles into the fabric of AI development. Unlike many nations that struggle to keep pace with technological advancements, South Korea has proactively shaped its AI ecosystem through a combination of planning, ethical guidelines, and legislative frameworks focusing on innovation and regulation. The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence stands as a cornerstone of South Korea’s AI governance approach. The Ministry of Science and ICT introduced this plan in 2019 transforming the country’s AI scene. It outlined a goal for South Korea to become a world leader in AI innovation and use. It stresses the value of public good and national edge . The plan shows a future where AI boosts output, improves life quality, and places South Korea as a global AI force. This full view sets South Korea apart from other nations that often chase money gains at the cost of ethical thoughts. South Korea’s adoption of National Guidelines for AI Ethics in 2020 is significant. These rules are some of the first big ethical frameworks to govern AI . The guidelines put people first. They focus on key ideas like respecting human dignity, keeping personal information safe, and making sure everyone’s included. They also stress the importance of stopping harm, boosting the public good, and fostering unity in AI growth. South Korea showed its commitment to make sure AI tech lines up with key human rights like dignity and privacy. The country kept up its momentum in 2021 by introducing the Strategy to Realize Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. This plan expanded the ethical framework to create a more thorough governance model. The strategy rested on three main supports: technology, systems, and ethics . It stressed the need to develop reliable AI tech set up institutional structures to encourage responsible AI use, and include AI ethics training throughout the development process. In 2022 , a strong step was taken in form of adoption of the AI Ethics Framework Enhancement Project . Through this initiative, practical tools like the AI Ethics Self-Checklist and Guidelines for AI Ethics Education Content were introduced. These resources help developers assess the ethical implications of their projects and integrate ethics into their daily practices. The project also produced tailored checklists for a variety of industries, acknowledging that ethical dilemmas can vary quite a bit from industry to industry while also incorporating educational institutions with the same level of competency. In 2023, the country took significant strides with its AI Ethics Framework Enhancement Project Phase II , aiming to fine-tune and roll out AI ethics policies through collaborative discussions. These forums brought together policymakers, industry experts, and members of civil society to tackle the challenges and innovations in AI governance. By making ethics a continuous focus rather than a one-off project, South Korea has established itself as a forward-thinking leader in responsible AI development. This ongoing approach enables the country to adjust its policies in line with new technologies and global trends, ensuring that its regulatory framework stays relevant and effective. The essence of these efforts is the groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence Act , which is set to launch in 2026 . This legislation marks a bold and comprehensive move to regulate AI while still encouraging innovation. At its heart is a risk-based regulatory framework that classifies AI systems according to their potential impact on society. High-risk applications—like those in healthcare, transportation, and criminal justice – face strict requirements, including risk assessments, transparency protocols, and human oversight. Transparency is a key element of the Act. Companies are required to inform users when they are using AI services for customers and consumers, especially in generative AI applications where content might easily be mistaken for something created by a human. This requirement helps combat misinformation and ensures that users know when they’re engaging with AI-driven systems. These transparency measures foster public trust and instill a sense of accountability . To ensure these regulations are put into action, the Act sets up the National Artificial Intelligence Committee , aided by committees and sub-committees – led by the President of South Korea. This important group is responsible for shaping the country’s AI policies, keeping an eye on compliance, and tackling new challenges as they arise. With a five-year term , the committee is designed to adapt to the fast-paced world of AI technology, making sure that governance stays flexible and responsive. The Act also advocates for AI ethics and safety through a decentralized approach wherein organizations are encouraged to set up independent ethics committees to assess the societal impacts of their AI initiatives. The Artificial Intelligence Act also promotes innovation, particularly for SMEs , by offering technical and financial support to ease compliance. South Korea is investing in AI innovation hubs to foster collaboration between academia, industry, and government, proving that regulation and innovation can coexist. By balancing progress with responsibility, the country has created a regulatory framework that drives creativity while protecting societal values. With strong ethical guidelines and comprehensive laws, South Korea is set to reinforce its global leadership in AI governance when the Act takes effect in 2026 .

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "AI REGULATIONS IN MONGOLIA", "url": "https://justai.in/ai-regulations-in-mongolia/", "raw_text": "Mongolia is standing at a crucial crossroads in its digital transformation journey, with artificial intelligence (AI) taking centre stage as a key element of its strategy to promote inclusive growth and technological progress. The government, working hand in hand with international partners, is setting up a solid regulatory framework to tap into AI’s potential while also tackling its challenges. This blog delves into Mongolia’s changing AI landscape, the regulatory steps being taken, and the collaborative efforts that are shaping its future. Mongolia’s readiness for digital advancement, as detailed in the National Digital Strategy Primer , showcases the country’s ability to harness AI for both economic and social development. With a young population over 70% under the age of 40, and a high literacy rate , Mongolia is in a great position to embrace AI technologies. However, there are significant hurdles to overcome, especially regarding digital access in rural areas and ger districts. Only 80% of the population has reliable electricity, and for the 30% living below the poverty line , internet affordability is a real concern. These challenges highlight the urgent need for inclusive policies that guarantee fair access to AI-driven solutions. The Mongolian government is making some exciting moves to weave AI into its national plans. In 2024 , the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications (MDDIC) teamed up with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to kick off the National AI Strategy . This initiative is all about putting Mongolia on the map as a regional AI leader by honing in on education, infrastructure, and ethical governance. A big part of the strategy is about building capacity, with a goal to train 25% of teachers in digital literacy by 2025 and roll out coding boot camps to nurture local AI talent. These initiatives tie in nicely with the Digital Readiness Assessment , which highlights human capital as a key driver for Mongolia’s digital economy. While the regulatory frameworks for AI in Mongolia are still getting off the ground, they’re evolving quickly. The government is focused on creating a “ friendly environment for businesses ” through flexible regulations. For example, the Pathways for Prosperity Commission suggests using regulatory sandboxes to experiment with AI innovations without hindering growth. This is especially important for start-ups, which often struggle with funding – there are only a few venture capital funds operating in Mongolia. The National AI Strategy also includes plans for tax incentives aimed at boosting AI research and development (R&D), with the hope of attracting international investment and igniting domestic innovation. Ethical considerations are at the heart of Mongolia’s AI regulations. The reforms supported by UNESCO to enhance media freedom laws include measures to tackle AI-generated disinformation, reflecting global worries about AI misuse. Moreover, the Digital Strategy Primer calls for a national cybersecurity framework to tackle vulnerabilities, as Mongolia currently ranks 85th on the Global Cybersecurity Index . The upcoming Data Protection Law , set to roll out in 2025 , will lay down guidelines for ethical AI use, ensuring transparency in algorithmic decision-making and protections against bias. These steps are crucial for fostering public trust especially in sectors like healthcare and education. International collaboration plays a crucial role in shaping Mongolia’s approach to AI regulation. The German Development Agency (GIZ) is helping Mongolia modernize its judicial system by integrating AI tools that boost transparency and efficiency. On a similar note, the partnership with UNDP aims to harness AI for sustainable development, utilizing predictive analytics to enhance resource management in key sectors like mining and agriculture both of which are vital to Mongolia’s economy. These efforts reflect Mongolia’s desire to strike a balance between fostering innovation and implementing necessary regulations, ensuring that AI contributes to the greater good of society. However, there are still hurdles to overcome. The Digital Readiness Assessment highlights a disconnect between the education system and the needs of the labour market, with employers noting a three-year gap in the readiness of graduates for tech positions. Tackling this issue will require not just updates to the curriculum but also ongoing learning opportunities to help workers adapt to changes brought about by AI automation. Additionally, the absence of a cohesive data governance framework is a barrier to effective AI implementation. The National AI Strategy suggests creating an open-data platform to encourage innovation, but its success will depend on addressing infrastructural and bureaucratic challenges. Looking forward, Mongolia’s AI regulations will need to carefully balance innovation, inclusivity, and ethical considerations. Given the country’s small domestic market and dependence on global technology imports, it’s essential to develop policies that nurture local AI ecosystems while adhering to international standards. The Digital Strategy Primer envisions a “ digitally inclusive society ”, where AI helps bridge the gap between urban and rural areas and empowers marginalized communities. Achieving this vision will demand ongoing investment in connectivity, education, and flexible regulatory frameworks. In short, Mongolia’s approach to AI regulation reflects its greater digital ambitions finding a balance between embracing new technology and ensuring inclusive governance. By emphasizing ethical guidelines, developing international partnerships, and investing in human capital, Mongolia is positioning itself for AI to drive sustainable growth. With the National AI Strategy moving forward, its success will rely on the government’s ability to convert visions into reality, ensuring that each and every Mongolian can benefit from AI in this digital age.

(10.04.2025)", "url": "https://justai.in/eus-new-action-plan-a-move-to-become-a-global-ai-powerhouse-10-04-2025/", "raw_text": "On 9th April, 2025, the European Commission launched the AI Continent Action Plan , an ambitious initiative aimed at establishing the European Union as a global powerhouse in artificial intelligence. The plan, first introduced by President Ursula von der Leyen at the AI Action Summit in February 2025 in Paris, outlines bold strategies to transform Europe’s strong industrial base and deep talent pool into engines of innovation and AI excellence. Five Pillars of the Action Plan The plan sets out actions across five core areas: infrastructure, data access, adoption of AI, AI talent development, and regulatory simplification. Together, these pillars are intended to position Europe at the forefront of AI development, innovation, and deployment. 1. Supercomputing Powerhouses: AI Factories and Gigafactories A key focus of the plan is the expansion of AI and supercomputing infrastructure across the continent. The Commission announced the establishment of a network of AI Factories , with 13 already being deployed around Europe’s supercomputers. These AI Factories will serve as “ open and dynamic AI ecosystems ,” offering computing power, data access, and collaboration opportunities. According to the Commission, they will “support EU AI startups, industry and researchers in developing AI models and applications.” Complementing this effort is the introduction of AI Gigafactories —large-scale facilities featuring approximately 100,000 state-of-the-art AI chips, “ four times more than current AI factories. ” These are designed to provide unprecedented computing power and are expected to be “ the next wave of frontier AI models .” The Commission is inviting expressions of interest from potential consortia and has launched InvestAI , an initiative to mobilise €20 billion in private investment for up to five AI Gigafactories. 2. Cloud and AI Development Act To further support AI infrastructure, the Commission will propose a Cloud and AI Development Act , aiming to “at least triple the EU’s data centre capacity in the next five to seven years.” The Act will prioritise sustainable development of cloud infrastructure and offer incentives for investment in green data centres. 3. Improving Access to Data: Data Labs and Data Union Strategy Recognising the centrality of data to AI, the Action Plan includes the launch of Data Labs . These labs will be based in the AI Factories and will “bring together and curate large, high-quality data volumes from different sources.” A Data Union Strategy , to be unveiled later in 2025, will underpin efforts to create a single internal market for data. 4. Apply AI Strategy to Drive Sectoral Adoption Despite AI’s potential, only 13.5% of EU companies currently use AI, prompting the Commission to roll out a targeted Apply AI Strategy . The Strategy will focus on boosting the use of AI in strategic sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, climate, and finance. “ We need to accelerate its adoption to increase productivity and create new products and services, ” said Executive Vice-President Virkkunen, emphasising the importance of AI in both the private and public sectors. The Commission is launching multiple initiatives to meet the rising demand for skilled AI professionals. These include international recruitment efforts, the AI Skills Academy , and the MSCA Choose Europe programme to attract and retain researchers. According to the Commission, Europe already has a strong starting point, with “30% more AI researchers than in the US.” The new programmes will aim to “train the next generation of AI specialists” and include AI-specific degrees, apprenticeships, and “returnship” schemes for women in AI. The AI Skills Academy , opening a call for proposals on April 15, 2025, will provide training on AI and generative AI, targeting students and professionals alike. 5. Simplifying the Rules: Regulatory Guidance and AI Act Service Desk The final pillar of the Action Plan aims to simplify regulatory frameworks and help companies comply with the AI Act , which entered into force in August 2024. A new AI Act Service Desk will be launched in July 2025, providing “a central point of contact and hub for information and guidance on the AI Act.” Executive Vice-President Virkkunen emphasized that “around 85% of all AI systems remain unregulated” under the AI Act and that “for the remaining 15% we want to achieve a maximum of simplicity.” To that end, the Commission is preparing guidance documents, self-assessment tools, and templates to assist businesses in complying with the new rules. Stakeholder Engagement and Public Consultations In parallel with the Action Plan, the Commission opened two public consultations running until June 4, 2025. These focus on the Cloud and AI Development Act and the Apply AI Strategy , inviting stakeholders to provide input on regulatory and practical challenges. A third consultation on the Data Union Strategy will launch in May. Additionally, dialogues with industry and public sector stakeholders will take place to further refine the implementation of the plan and identify AI use opportunities. AI Factory Tour Begins To kickstart engagement, Executive Vice-President Virkkunen announced an AI Factory Tour , beginning with Luxprovide in Luxembourg this month, followed by Jupiter in Jülich, Germany , and Cineca in Bologna, Italy . “ Time for action is now! ” she declared during her remarks in Brussels. What does this plan exude for Europe? With the AI Continent Action Plan , the European Union is laying the foundation for a robust, inclusive, and sustainable AI ecosystem. By integrating infrastructure, data, talent, and regulatory frameworks, the EU is taking a decisive step toward becoming a “leading AI continent.” As the Commission emphasises, “AI is no longer ‘just’ a competitive advantage; it’s a necessity to be competitive and to close the innovation gap.” REFERENCES https://commission.europa.eu/topics/eu-competitiveness/ai-continent_en https://ieu-monitoring.com/editorial/eu-commission-announces-ai-continent-action-plan-to-become-global-ai-leader/607502/", "summary": "Authored by Mr. Abhishek (A student of Symbiosis Law School, Noida)", "published_date": "2025-04-10T18:40:30", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.733685", "tags": [240], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "EU’S NEW ACTION PLAN: A MOVE TO BECOME A GLOBAL AI POWERHOUSE?

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has weighed in on the growing controversy surrounding AI-generated art , particularly in light of the recent viral trend mimicking Studio Ghibli’s animation style . In a virtual appearance on a podcast hosted by Indian entrepreneur Varun Mayya, Altman expressed his views about AI’s impact on the creative industry, job market, and more, defending the technology as a democratizing force. Viral Ghibli Trend Reignites AI Art Debate The interview comes in the wake of the explosive popularity of AI-generated images created in the visual style of Japan’s iconic Studio Ghibli. The trend was catalyzed by the integration of a native image generation feature into ChatGPT, powered by the GPT-4o model. The incident sparked intense debate online between AI enthusiasts and critics, further deepening the divide around ethical and creative concerns. Altman: “A Big Net Win for Society” Acknowledging the backlash, Altman admitted there are drawbacks to the widespread use of AI in the arts but maintained that the overall impact is positive. “I think the democratisation of creating content has been a big net win for society. It has not been a complete win, there are negative things about it for sure, and certainly it did something about the art form, but I think on the whole it’s been a win,” Altman stated. Miyazaki Critique Resurfaces Amid the backlash, a video resurfaced featuring legendary animator and Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, in which he described AI as “an insult to life.” While some social media users argued the clip was taken out of context, the video added fuel to the fire. When asked about the comment, Altman did not dismiss the concern but reiterated the broader societal benefit of AI-generated content. “It doesn’t mean that it [AI-generated art] doesn’t cause some job loss, and some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition. But overall I think it’s a real benefit to society.” AI Creating More Competition for Artists Altman admitted that AI-generated art introduces new competition for traditional artists, especially those with niche skills. However, he pointed to technology’s ability to lower the barrier of entry as a transformative force. “My own experience of this was watching the barrier to entry to starting a company really change. OpenAI itself was an example of a company that only got to happen because the barriers to entry to a bunch of different pieces of technology stack got significantly low and this ragtag bunch of us were able to just do something we had no right to do,” he said. Image Generation Usage Soars Since the rollout of the image generator in ChatGPT, user activity has surged. According to OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap, over 700 million images have been generated by 130 million users, and the billion-image milestone is approaching fast. Altman highlighted both creative and commercial applications for the tool: “The thing that’s been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases. […] There’s obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are using this for their small businesses to generate new logos or graphic designs…” India Becomes OpenAI’s Fastest Growing Market In the same podcast, Altman emphasized India’s rapid adoption of AI tools, calling it OpenAI’s fastest growing market outside the United States. “India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened, it is now our fastest growing market,” Altman revealed. On lowering ChatGPT subscription prices in India, he said: “Unfortunately, our compute costs are still just quite high but we are hard at work on more efficient models, and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to bring cost down over time.” Reports have also indicated that OpenAI is in talks with Jio Platforms to localize data hosting and distribution of ChatGPT services for Indian enterprises. Job Market Will Be Unevenly Affected Discussing the future of work in an AI-powered world, Altman said the impact will vary by profession. “It’ll be different for different kinds of jobs. There will be some jobs that totally go away because the AI just does them end to end. Mostly I think it’ll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality.” Using graphic design as an example, Altman noted that despite automation, human taste remains relevant:“Maybe there will be more people that do [graphic design] because we just have an explosion of how many websites we can get [using AI]. Maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than we could afford to fill.” AI to Supercharge Coding Productivity Altman also discussed how AI is transforming the coding landscape. “If there’s one area where I think that the world just has so much more demand than we can currently supply, it’s for writing code,” he said. He added that AI tools could drastically improve productivity: “AI could make a coder 10 times more predictive within this year or next year.” Altman explained that while AI might reduce the market price for code, it would likely increase output due to Jevons Paradox — a situation where increased efficiency leads to higher overall demand. GPT-Wrappers and the Startup Boom Addressing criticism of companies built on OpenAI’s models — often dismissed as “GPT-wrappers” — Altman drew parallels to earlier tech trends. “People are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI. Most of them will fail or not do that well but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value and that’s always the case.” He encouraged young entrepreneurs to pursue their ideas boldly:“Some 20-year-old at Y Combinator probably has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me, but it’s probably going to be the next OpenAI […] So go do your crazy idea is my advice.” REFERENCES https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-defends-ai-art-ghibli-backlash-podcast-interview-9930216/ https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-studio-ghibli-ai-art-image-generator-backlash-2025-4", "summary": "Authored by Mr. Abhishek (A student of Symbiosis Law School, Noida)", "published_date": "2025-04-08T18:59:36", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.741765", "tags": [237], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "SAM ALTMAN DEFENDS AI GENERATED ART AMID ‘GHIBLI’ CONTROVERSY, SAYS IT IS A ‘NET WIN’ FOR SOCIETY (08. 04. 25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/sam-altman-defends-ai-art-amid-ghibli-controversy-says-its-a-net-win-for-society-april-8-2025/"}}

OpenAI. ANI filed a case against OpenAI for using copyrighted content to train its artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT, without authorization. Senior Advocate Amit Sibal, representing OpenAI, asserted that since the training of its Large Language Model (LLM) and data storage occur outside India, the Indian Copyright Act does not extend to the company’s activities. Sibal emphasized that no part of the alleged infringement has taken place within Indian territory and that the Copyright Act’s jurisdiction is limited to India . “Any action that is claimed to be infringement must take place in the four corners of this country. If it doesn’t, that particular action can’t be infringement,” argued Sibal before the court. ANI’s Allegations of Copyright Violation ANI Media Pvt Ltd contends that OpenAI scraped its content from its website and subscriber data to train ChatGPT, thereby infringing its copyright for commercial benefit. ANI has accused OpenAI of using its proprietary content without permission, raising significant concerns over the protection of journalistic material in the digital age. According to ANI, OpenAI’s alleged actions amount to copyright infringement as the chatbot’s responses might incorporate ANI’s news content without proper attribution. The case has sparked broader discussions on the intersection of artificial intelligence, data usage, and copyright laws in India. OpenAI Denies Storing ANI’s Data in India In response to ANI’s claims, OpenAI has maintained that it does not store ANI’s data in India and does not use it for generating responses through ChatGPT. Sibal underscored that there is no evidence to suggest that OpenAI’s AI models retain or reproduce verbatim content from ANI’s website or subscriber services. “The LLM does not store data verbatim from specific sources but rather uses vast, diverse datasets, learning from linguistic structures and grammar in the public domain,” Sibal stated. He further explained that the AI model does not retain or replicate specific copyrighted articles but generates responses based on language patterns derived from publicly available information. Legal Debate Over Copyright and AI Training One of the central arguments in the case revolves around the definition of copyright infringement under Indian law. Sibal argued that the use of data in AI training does not violate the Copyright Act, as the law protects only the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves or the factual content used to train AI models. He emphasized that AI training involves analysing language structures rather than copying specific articles. This distinction, according to OpenAI, means that its operations fall outside the scope of copyright infringement as defined by Indian law. Key Issues Before the Delhi High Court As the case proceeds, the Delhi High Court is considering four key issues: Whether OpenAI’s storage and use of ANI’s data amount to copyright infringement under Indian law. Whether the Indian Copyright Act applies to OpenAI’s operations given that its data storage and training occur outside India. Whether the alleged actions by OpenAI qualify for fair use under Indian copyright law. The broader implications of AI-generated content and the extent to which AI models can utilize publicly available data without violating copyright laws. The High Court’s decision on these matters is expected to set a crucial precedent for the use of AI in content generation and copyright protection in India. What’s Next? With OpenAI continuing its legal arguments in the next hearing, the case is being closely watched by the media and technology sectors. If the court rules in favour of ANI, it could impose stricter regulations on AI companies operating in India and potentially impact how AI models are trained globally. Conversely, a ruling favouring OpenAI could establish a legal precedent allowing AI developers more freedom in utilizing publicly available data for machine learning purposes. The outcome may also influence future policy discussions regarding copyright laws and their applicability to AI-generated content. As AI continues to evolve and reshape industries, this case underscores the growing tension between technological innovation and intellectual property rights. The Delhi High Court’s ruling will likely have significant implications for AI developers, media organizations, and legal frameworks governing digital content in India and beyond.

(24.03.2025)", "url": "https://justai.in/deepseek-v3-0324-new-deepseek-model-released-march-24-2025/", "raw_text": "New Model Released, Again Open-Sourced- In a surprise move that has excited open-source AI enthusiasts, DeepSeek has released an updated version of its large language model, DeepSeek V3–0324. The checkpoint, made available on March 24, 2025, marks another step in DeepSeek’s aggressive innovation strategy, following the widely-discussed release of DeepSeek V3 in December 2024. The company has again chosen to fully open-source the model , hosting it publicly on HuggingFace — a move welcomed by developers and researchers eager to explore its expanded capabilities. What Is DeepSeek V3–0324? According to the initial Reddit discussions and community tests, DeepSeek V3–0324 is “an updated checkpoint for DeepSeek’s old model, DeepSeek V3, which was released Dec’24.” While DeepSeek has not officially released technical documentation or performance benchmarks at the time of publication, community reports suggest several notable upgrades. As one Reddit post summarized, “The model boasts 685B parameters and a MoE model.” The updated model also supports a context window of 131k tokens , offering the ability to process significantly longer texts than previous versions. Users have noted that this opens the door to handling more complex documents and conversations. One of the standout improvements appears to be speed. “The output/sec stands at 20=/sec. This is blazing fast,” one early tester shared. Improvements in Coding Capabilities In addition to broader context and speed, developers are already highlighting improvements in programming assistance. “The coding abilities are looking better compared to previous DeepSeek models,” a Reddit user posted, sparking early interest in using the model for software development and debugging. Although no official performance statistics or benchmarks have been released, initial tests are underway by community members. One user reported the model was able to pass complex reasoning tasks, including simulations like “bouncing ball in rotating shape.” V3–0324: Foundation for the Upcoming R2 Model? Speculation is mounting about whether DeepSeek V3–0324 is a precursor to the highly anticipated DeepSeek R2, a reasoning-focused model rumored to launch in April or May 2025. According to the post, “Many speculate that this updated V3–0324 will serve as the foundation for DeepSeek-R2.” While DeepSeek has yet to confirm this, the model’s increased reasoning capability and performance upgrades suggest a strategic ramp-up toward R2’s release. Personality Shift: More Power, Less Personality? Despite the performance upgrades, some users have noted a shift in the model’s tone and conversational style. “A few users felt the new version sounded ‘more robotic’ compared to the original V3, which had a more human-like, conversational tone,” stated one report. Another user added, “Some mentioned it now feels ‘too intellectual’ and less engaging for casual chat.” This change may be the result of fine-tuning decisions aimed at improving logic and coherence, potentially at the cost of relatability. DeepSeek V3 vs DeepSeek V3–0324: What’s the Difference? While both models share the same architecture, the latest version appears to represent a polished, faster, and more capable evolution of its predecessor. The key differentiators include a higher parameter count, longer context length, improved reasoning, and much faster output speed. With the suffix “0324” indicating its release date — March 24 — this checkpoint provides a timely refresh for users who rely on DeepSeek models in creative, coding, and analytical domains. Benchmarks Still Missing Despite growing interest, there are no official benchmarks released yet for DeepSeek V3–0324. “No official benchmarks have been released yet, but independent tests are expected soon,” one user pointed out. AI communities and model evaluators across Reddit and HuggingFace forums have already begun crowd-sourced testing efforts, focusing particularly on reasoning and code generation. Free Access on DeepSeek’s Website For those eager to test the new model, it’s already available online for free. “As notified on Reddit, the model is updated on https://chat.deepseek.com/,” reads one community alert. This accessibility reflects DeepSeek’s continuing commitment to democratizing access to high-performance AI — a philosophy increasingly in contrast to more commercialized offerings from U.S.-based competitors. Early Community Reception: Cautiously Optimistic The AI community’s early reactions have been a mix of excitement and critical analysis. While many applaud the model’s speed and coding prowess, others are urging caution until more thorough benchmark testing becomes available. The absence of official documentation is also leaving many questions unanswered about the scope of changes under the hood. Still, the decision to open-source the model gives researchers and engineers a powerful tool for experimentation, free from licensing barriers. What’s Next? With DeepSeek-R2 anticipated in the coming months, the release of V3–0324 may be just a stepping stone. The company has not commented on whether this version will directly inform R2’s training or tuning, but the speculation persists. Users interested in keeping up with updates should monitor DeepSeek’s community channels and GitHub repositories for future checkpoint announcements, benchmarks, and technical notes. The original Reddit thread ends with a teaser: “Will be updating the blog once more info is available. By the time, try the new model by DeepSeek!” REFERENCES https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/deepseek-v3-0324-new-deepseek-model-released-0d8ab04e329d", "summary": "Authored by Mr. Abhishek (A student of Symbiosis Law School, Noida)", "published_date": "2025-03-24T19:04:10", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.755458", "tags": [238], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "DeepSeek RELEASED ITS UPDATED AI MODEL, DeepSeek V3-0324: WHAT’S NEW?

The company submitted its proposal for the U.S. government’s upcoming “AI Action Plan”, calling for what it describes as “the freedom to innovate in the national interest.” OpenAI Steps In After Trump Revokes AI Executive Order Just weeks into his second term, President Trump repealed the AI executive order titled “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, “ originally signed by President Biden in October 2023. That order was intended to introduce safeguards for AI development. But Trump scrapped it and instead issued a new order prioritizing America’s global AI dominance. In response, OpenAI moved swiftly to ensure its voice was heard in shaping the government’s AI strategy . The company’s proposal focuses on a fast-moving AI industry with minimal government interference. KEY POINTS OF OPENAI’S PROPOSAL: Light Regulations, Faster Growth: OpenAI is making it clear: it wants the government to step back. In its proposal, the company expressed frustration with what it sees as excessive AI regulation and pushed for a more flexible approach. OpenAI argues that “the federal government should work with both leading AI developers and startups on a purely voluntary and optional basis.” The proposal also takes a dig at state-level regulations, calling them “overly burdensome” and pushing for “a voluntary partnership between the federal government and the private sector.” National Security and AI Integration: OpenAI is also advocating for AI’s increased role in national security. The company suggests that federal agencies should have more freedom to test and experiment with real data. “The government needs models trained on classified datasets that are fine-tuned to be exceptional at national security tasks for which there is no commercial market — such as geospatial intelligence or classified nuclear tasks,” OpenAI states in the proposal. The company has already launched ChatGPT Gov , a version of its AI model specifically designed for government use. Speeding Up AI Adoption in Government: OpenAI is also urging the government to loosen approval requirements for AI systems. The proposal suggests temporarily waiving FedRAMP , the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program , which regulates cloud services for government agencies. It further recommends “modernizing” the approval process for AI security clearance, “establishing a faster, criteria-based path for approval of AI tools.” According to OpenAI, these changes could allow new AI services to be deployed “roughly 12 months earlier than current processes.” Freedom to Learn: One of the most controversial points in OpenAI’s proposal is its stance on copyright law. The company is calling for “a copyright strategy that promotes the freedom to learn” and “preserving American AI models’ ability to learn from copyrighted material.” According to OpenAI, “America has so many AI startups, attracts so much investment, and has made so many research breakthroughs largely because the fair use doctrine promotes AI development”. OpenAI is already in crossfires for facing copyright infringement lawsuits from major media organizations, including The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, and The Center for Investigative Reporting. Such a proposal can have global implications if accepted. OpenAI’s Growing Clashes with Elon Musk and Trump’s Administration Adding to the tension, OpenAI is navigating a complex political and business landscape. The company is currently locked in a heated legal and public relations battle with Elon Musk, a major Trump ally and the owner of a rival AI startup. Musk, a former co-founder of OpenAI, has been critical of the company’s direction and has filed a lawsuit alleging that OpenAI deviated from its original nonprofit mission. At the same time, OpenAI is positioning itself as a key player in Trump’s AI strategy. The company was involved in the administration’s “Stargate” AI initiative , a multi-billion-dollar investment in AI infrastructure. OpenAI is also exploring new data center campuses in 16 states, where state governments have expressed “real interest” in hosting AI development sites. The China Factor OpenAI’s proposal also targets China’s AI industry, warning that U.S. leadership in AI is under threat. The company specifically calls out DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, as a major competitor. The report points out that in January 2025, DeepSeek’s app went viral in the U.S., even surpassing ChatGPT on Apple’s App Store. One major concern? DeepSeek reportedly developed its AI model at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. While OpenAI’s model training costs can exceed $100 million, DeepSeek’s R1 model was reportedly built for just $6 million. OpenAI warns that “while America maintains a lead on AI today, DeepSeek shows that our lead is not wide and is narrowing.” What’s Next ? With OpenAI making its case for deregulation, the Trump administration faces a pivotal decision. The AI Action Plan is due by July 2025, and its contents could shape the future of artificial intelligence in the United States. Will the government embrace OpenAI’s vision of a hands-off approach to AI development? Or will concerns over security, copyright, and AI ethics force stricter regulations? For now, one thing is certain: the battle over AI policy is just getting started.

The recommendation was made under the Trump administration’s ongoing AI Action Plan initiative and comes amid increasing concerns over data privacy and national security. OpenAI described DeepSeek as “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and warned that its viral reasoning model, R1, poses significant threats of interference by the Chinese government. The company stated that the models could “expose U.S. technology allies to national security risks” and recommended that all Tier 1 countries under U.S. export rules — 18 of America’s most trusted allies — take immediate steps to ban DeepSeek’s models. Accusations Escalate Amid Rising Tensions The proposal marked an escalation in OpenAI’s campaign against DeepSeek. The company has previously accused DeepSeek of “distilling” knowledge from OpenAI’s models against its terms of service. However, this time, the allegations took on a geopolitical tone, highlighting that DeepSeek “is supported by the PRC and under its command.” DeepSeek gained traction earlier in the year and became the focus of increased scrutiny after its founder, Liang Wenfeng, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in February. The connection has heightened concerns among Western tech and policy circles, especially regarding the potential for Chinese law to compel tech companies to share sensitive user data. Concerns About Open-Source AI Misplaced? Despite OpenAI’s security-based argument, several experts have pointed out a crucial distinction between DeepSeek’s open-source models and its hosted services. The ambiguity in OpenAI’s policy document—specifically regarding whether the ban applies to DeepSeek’s API, open models, or both—has sparked criticism and calls for clarification. “While data security is always a consideration for hosted services, our research indicates the open-sourced DeepSeek model is itself free of CCP bias — therefore, a blanket ban on the model, even if it’s hosted in the USA, is unjustified,” said Robert Caulk, CEO of AskNews.app. This perspective is echoed across the industry. “The real security question isn’t about the model itself but about where user data flows,” said Michael Newman, director of transformation at Graham Media Group. He emphasized the importance of discerning between “directly using an API connected to an overseas server” and “self-hosting open-source models or APIs through a secure provider like AWS.” Broadcast and Media Industry on Alert The potential implications of the proposed ban extend far beyond policy and into the realm of media and broadcasting. As AI becomes increasingly essential for automated transcription, editing, and analytics, media companies have begun adopting affordable open-source reasoning models like DeepSeek R1. “The proposed ban could have far-reaching implications for the broadcast TV and media industry, where affordable open-source AI reasoning models are increasingly being considered for content creation, data analysis and audience engagement,” the proposal noted. Security risks associated with DeepSeek’s direct services—such as its website, apps, and cloud API—are cause for concern. If compromised, these platforms could potentially leak sensitive data from media firms and endanger editorial content or viewer privacy. OpenAI Walks Back as Criticism Mounts Just two days after the initial submission, OpenAI appeared to scale back its original stance. In a statement to TechCrunch on March 15, spokesperson Liz Bourgeois clarified that the company’s focus was less about banning the model itself and more about ensuring secure data infrastructure. “We’re not advocating for restrictions on people using models like DeepSeek. What we’re proposing are changes to U.S. export rules that would allow additional countries to access U.S. compute on the condition that their datacenters don’t rely on PRC technology that present[s] security risks — instead of restricting their access to chips based on the assumption that they will divert technology to the PRC,” Bourgeois explained. This revision points to a shift from concerns over the model’s structure or capability to the underlying infrastructure and data governance supporting AI platforms. Experts Weigh in on Strategic Motives While security remains a priority, some industry leaders believe OpenAI’s move may also be strategically motivated. DeepSeek’s R1 model has garnered attention for delivering comparable capabilities to OpenAI’s offerings at a much lower cost. “Depending on where data is stored, OpenAI’s call for a ban reflects deep security concerns. Yet, this proposal also appears to be a strategic maneuver aimed at limiting competitor influence. The concern here for news is much larger than DeepSeek,” said Josh Brandau, CEO of NOTA. The Rising Geopolitics of AI OpenAI’s actions highlight the growing intersection between AI technology and global politics. The rise of state-backed models like DeepSeek is shifting the battleground from military to algorithmic dominance. As national governments move to assert sovereignty over data and technology, media organizations are left to navigate a fragmented, politically charged AI ecosystem. “The question isn’t simply whether DeepSeek poses a security threat, but whether our institutions can meaningfully distinguish between legitimate national security concerns and corporate protectionist impulses,” the report concluded. In this new digital era, media companies and policymakers alike face a crucial challenge: ensuring freedom, fairness, and transparency in the AI systems that increasingly shape how information is produced and consumed.

The Measures were jointly issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China , the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology , the Ministry of Public Security , and the National Radio and Television Administration . Following the release of a draft in September 2024, the finalised Measures are set to take effect on 1 September 2025 . Introduction The new measures introduced by China provide the standard requirements to be followed by the providers of generation and synthesis services. The measures mandate the providers to add explicit and implicit labels (as applicable) to generated synthetic content, including texts, images, audios, videos and virtual scenes. The measures are followed by the earlier released Cybersecurity Standard Practice Guide – Generative Artificial Intelligence Service Content Identification Method , issued in August 2023 by the National Information Security Standardisation Technical Committee (TC260) , which laid the groundwork for identifying AI-generated content. Applicability of the Measures The Measures target internet-based information service providers engaged in AI-generated content labelling. The measures are specifically applied to providers already required to comply with the earlier regulations: Administrative Provisions on Recommendation Algorithms in Internet-based Information Services (Recommendation Algorithms Provisions) – Regulating the use of algorithm technologies for content recommendations. Administrative Provisions on Deep Synthesis in Internet-based Information Services (Deep Synthesis Provisions) – Addressing the use of deep synthesis technologies in online services. Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services (GenAI Measures) – Governing the use of AI to generate texts, images, audios, and videos. Explicit and Implicit Labelling Requirements Under the Measures, service providers must implement explicit and implicit labels to distinguish AI-generated content. “Explicit Labels: Service providers are required to add clear labels (such as text and voice prompts and visual symbols) to AI-generated content that is considered high-risk in causing confusion or misrecognition among the public under the Deep Synthesis Provisions (such as smart dialogue, voice synthesis and face generation services),” the document states. Explicit labelling methods vary based on content type: Text – Text prompts or symbols at the start, end, or within the content. Audio – Audio prompts at the beginning, end, or within the audio file. Images – Visible signs in appropriate positions. Videos – Identifiers at the start, end, or around the video. Virtual Scenes – Identifiers at the start and during the service process. Other Scenarios – Unique prominent signs tailored to the specific context. Furthermore, “Implicit Labels: Service providers must embed implicit labels in the metadata of the generated content, which should include information such as content attributes, provider name, and content number.” Verification and Compliance Measures To ensure compliance, providers of content dissemination services must verify the presence of implicit labels and add explicit ones where necessary. “Verification Measures: Providers of content dissemination services must verify the presence of implicit labels (such as by checking the metadata of documents) and add explicit labels if the content is identified as AI-generated.” Additionally, service providers must revise user agreements to clarify labelling obligations. “User Agreements: Service providers must clearly outline labelling methods and requirements in user service agreements to ensure that users understand their obligations regarding content labelling. The Measures also permit a user to request a service provider to provide generated and synthetic content without explicit labels, and the service provider is permitted to do so provided that it has clarified the user’s obligations in the user agreement and retains relevant logs for not less than 6 months.” Implications for Businesses Businesses that provide AI generation or synthesis services are expected to review their current technical and legal frameworks to ensure compliance before the Measures take effect. As the next steps, businesses providing AI generation or synthesis services should review their existing technical setup and the relevant user terms and conditions or agreements and update internal policies to ensure compliance before the lapse of the transitional period. China’s Expanding AI Regulatory Landscape As the Chinese government announced in July 2024 that the country is looking to formulate over 50 standards for the AI sector by 2026 , it is important to monitor further development of laws and standards related to internet information services and AI technology in China. With the AI industry evolving rapidly, legal and regulatory shifts in China are expected to have significant consequences for both domestic and international technology firms. As China advances its AI governance framework, global businesses operating in the region must stay informed and adapt to ensure regulatory compliance in the evolving landscape.

SNE Director General Renaud Lefebvre emphasized the magnitude of the case, comparing it to the biblical story of David and Goliath. “It’s a bit of a David versus Goliath battle,” he stated. “It’s a procedure that serves as an example.” Broader Legal Implications This case marks the first legal action against an AI company for copyright infringement in France hence making France a part of the broader wave of lawsuits filed worldwide against major technology firms accused of improperly using copyrighted data to develop their AI models. In the United States, Meta has been targeted by multiple lawsuits from authors and copyright holders. Notably, in 2023, American actress and author Sarah Silverman, along with other writers, filed a lawsuit against Meta, alleging that their books were misused in training its large language model, Llama. The legal action argues that Meta failed to seek permission or compensate the authors for the use of their work. A similar lawsuit was filed in October 2024 by American novelist Christopher Farnsworth, further intensifying scrutiny on Meta’s data usage practices. Beyond Meta, other AI industry leaders face similar legal challenges. OpenAI, the company behind the widely used AI tool ChatGPT, is currently battling multiple lawsuits in the United States, Canada, and India. These cases similarly revolve around allegations of unauthorized use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Meta’s Response and Industry Reactions As of now, Meta has not issued an official response to the lawsuit filed in France. When approached for comments, representatives for the company did not immediately reply. The growing number of lawsuits highlights a pressing issue in the AI industry: the ethical and legal implications of using vast amounts of online content for AI training. Content creators, authors, and artists worldwide are raising concerns about fair compensation and intellectual property rights in an era where AI technologies are advancing rapidly. Legal experts suggest that the outcome of this case could set a precedent for future AI-related copyright disputes in Europe and beyond. The French lawsuit is particularly significant given the European Union’s strong regulatory stance on digital rights and data protection. The Future of AI and Copyright Law The legal confrontation between French publishers and Meta underscores the increasing tensions between technology companies and content creators. As AI models continue to evolve, the debate over data usage, intellectual property rights, and fair compensation is expected to intensify. The case also raises questions about how AI firms acquire and use data, and whether existing copyright laws are sufficient to address the challenges posed by generative AI. With multiple lawsuits already underway in various jurisdictions, regulators may be prompted to introduce clearer guidelines to balance technological innovation with the rights of content creators. For now, the publishing and authors’ associations in France remain firm in their pursuit of justice. Their lawsuit against Meta is not just a fight for their own industry but a broader call for accountability in the AI sector. As the legal proceedings unfold, the global technology community will be watching closely to see how courts navigate the complex intersection of AI, copyright law, and creative rights.

This strategized framework will serve as a blueprint designed to equip public officials with the necessary skills, knowledge, expertise, and ethical grounding to harness AI’s role in a more responsible and accountable manner. Moreover, for a mass-level awareness, targeting public sector officials marks a stepping stone for a manifest success amongst other target sectors. COMPETENCIES AND CAPACITY BUILDING According to this framework, t he public officials have been categorized into three levels – policy-level, mid-level, and project implementers thereby also delineating specific competencies for each mainly – behavioural, functional and domain-specific. Behavioural competencies like innovative thinking, systems thinking, and a focus on citizens are highlighted to foster a culture of adaptability and ethical responsibility amongst these officials. The aim is to make AL solutions resonate with societal values and effectively tackle the real-world challenges. Functional competencies dealing with a technical side of AI literacy, data governance, and stakeholder management lay a groundwork needed for a successful implementations of AI systems thereby acting with compliance. The domain specific competencies refine skills for key sectors on which basic functionality of nation depends such as – agriculture, healthcare, education, smart cities, and transportation, making AI solutions more impactful than just relevant. In order to build capacity, this frameworks lays focus on acknowledging different levels of AI readiness across various regions and department, suggests targeted training programs, collaborations in academia and partnerships with leading industry experts and organizations. Initiatives like Certification program in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Future Skills Prime are in motion to enhance expertise and skills of these government officials. Moreover, India’s active participation and collaboration in Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), underscores country’s role in shaping AI governance alongside calling for strong mitigation strategies, enhancing accountability to address the concern that AI decisions can be unclear and hard to understand. Here comes the role of human oversight ensuring that AI systems augment a structured decision-making process rather than replace huma judgment, particularly in instances of high-profile and sensitive industries like healthcare, pharma and criminal justice and judicial decision making. In highly important and crucial parts of economy such as in agriculture, AI powered tools like National Pest Surveillance System and Krishi 24/7 helps farmers understand detailed aspects of climate changes and combat with challenges such as crop yielding. These initiatives harness the power of AI to deliver real-time insights into pest infestations and weather patterns, helping farmers make well-informed decisions. In the healthcare sectors, the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission is using AI to streamline diagnostics and enhance patient care, showcasing how technology can improve service delivery in vital areas. Smart city project focusing on the niche area of real estate, are tapping into AI for energy efficiency and effective urban planning whilst the transportation industry has embraced the AI systems to boost road safety and cut down on road congestion. In other words, these are some basic examples wherein AI is being adapted and integrated deep into roots of daily life theoretical ideas and change their functional abilities so that it has some real benefits. GOVERNANCE IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR The framework’s suggestions for establishing AI governance are especially significant. Creation of AI Governance Board is advocated to ensure ethical compliance, standardized risk assessments and maintenance of transparent procurement processes. Privacy and data management protocols is crucial for protecting citizen rights, whilst the proposed public engagement platforms prove credible, reliable and trustworthy. These initiatives reflect a progressive mindset that balances innovation with accountability, making sure that AI systems are implemented ethically and responsibly. The document also stresses the need for ongoing monitoring and impact assessments to understand the social, economic, and ethical effects of AI systems, particularly on marginalized and vulnerable communities. This framework is a progressive thinking document paving the way for a future where AI can drive equitable development across domains, across individuals and across the world. Equipping public sector officials becomes significant since they engage with the public at large on the ground level and can help address their concerns more effectively, AI can reduce their workload and enhance their efficiency by equipping them with essential skills, encouraging cross-sector collaboration and also laying an ethical boundary of principles into these systems. The success of this framework is however, largely dependent on a commitment to adapt such shift in working of economy, willingness to undergo training and maintaining a larger focus on serving citizens – the real beneficiaries of this AI-driven world. This document aligns with the IndiaAI Mission, aiming at a safer, nuanced and quality usage of AI fostering innovation whilst also ensuring inclusive growth and digital transformation. The desire of achieving these objectives is also the biggest challenge that AI faces in India primarily – lack of awareness and secondary to it – data privacy, algorithmic biases and collusions thereby posing a greater threat on its ethical and fair usage.

The event saw the participation of global leaders, tech executives, and policymakers, aiming to establish a consensus on the future of AI. The summit emerged as a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over artificial intelligence (AI) governance. AI Action Summit, focused on fostering responsible AI development, and ensuring uniform AI governance through creation of globally accepted regulations and standards. However, the event also highlighted stark differences in approaches to AI regulation, particularly between the United States and its allies. China, France, Germany and India were among 61 signatories who agreed it is a priority that “AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy, taking into account international frameworks for all” and “making AI sustainable for people and the planet. Whereas , United States and UK made headlines by refusing to sign the same declaration on “inclusive and sustainable AI”. This is a significant issue because most of the major AI companies are based in the US. On the other hand, the UK, often ranked third globally in AI, holds substantial influence in this field as well. The first and third-ranking nations distancing themselves from international agreements signal a disturbing rupture, with this pattern also visible in their domestic AI polices too. What did the summit declaration say? The countries that attended were asked to sign a Pledge for a Trustworthy AI in the World of Work, a nonbinding declaration. The declaration outlined six main priorities: Promoting AI accessibility to reduce digital divides Ensuring AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy, taking into account international frameworks for all Making AI innovation thrive by enabling conditions for its development and avoiding market concentration driving industrial recovery and development Encouraging AI deployment that positively shapes the future of work and labour markets and delivers opportunity for sustainable growth Making AI sustainable for people and the planet Reinforcing international cooperation to promote coordination in international governance India’s Stance on AI Regulation in AI Action Summit The world is at the “dawn of the AI (Artificial Intelligence) age”, Prime Minister of India , Narendra Modi , called for collective efforts to establish a global framework for AI that upholds shared values, addresses risks, builds trust and ensures access to all, especially the Global South. Co-chairing the AI Action Summit with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, PM Modi underlined the need for open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency, and building data sets “free from biases”. He also offered to host the next summit in India. At a briefing later, S Krishnan, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), said India would host the next summit. “The time is right for India to host, as the Prime Minister offered, and the offer was accepted that the next AI Summit would be hosted in India later this year, India through PM Modi highlighted that there is a need for collective global efforts to establish governance and standards, that uphold our shared values, address risks and build trust.” Saying that governance is not just about managing risks and rivalries, but also about promoting innovation, and deploying it for the global good, he said: “We must think deeply and discuss openly about innovation and governance. We must build quality data sets, free from biases. We must democratise technology and create people-centric applications. We must address concerns related to cyber security, disinformation, and deep fakes. And, we must also ensure that technology is rooted in local ecosystems for it to be effective and useful,” he said. Welcoming the decision to set up the ‘AI Foundation’ and the ‘Council for Sustainable AI’, he congratulated France for these initiatives and assured India’s full support. China’s Stance on AI Regulation in Paris Summit AI has become an important driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, Zhang said. China has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude, he underlined. Zhang said China has always advocated enhancing the representation and voices of developing countries in global AI governance, ensuring equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules for AI development and governance of all countries, carrying out international cooperation and assistance for developing countries, and constantly bridging the intelligence gap and governance capacity gap. In October 2023, President Xi Jinping introduced the Global Initiative for AI Governance, which proposed China’s solution and contributed China’s wisdom for the AI development and governance, Zhang noted. In facing the opportunities and challenges brought about by the development of AI, Zhang called on the international community to jointly advocate for the principle of developing AI for good, to deepen innovative cooperation, strengthen inclusiveness and benefits, and improve global governance. Amid the global affirmation from China on responsible AI development, recently a generative model from Chinese Company DeepSeek ushers a different story. DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company founded in July 2023, has recently introduced its R1 model, a large language model (LLM) that has garnered significant attention in the AI community. The R1 model is reported to offer performance comparable to other leading LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT, with a notably lower training cost of approximately $6 million, compared to the $100 million invested in GPT-4. The introduction of DeepSeek’s R1 model has also raised geopolitical concerns, leading several countries to ban its use on government devices. Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States have cited national security and data privacy issues as primary reasons for these bans. The apprehension stems from DeepSeek’s compliance with Chinese government censorship policies and its data collection practices, which some fear could lead to the dissemination of biased information and unauthorized data access. U.S. Stance on AI Regulation in Paris AI Action Summit United States Vice President JD Vance made headlines by refusing to sign a declaration on inclusive and sustainable AI, which was endorsed by over 60 countries, including Canada, the European Commission, India, and China. In his first major international appearance, Vance argued that “excessive regulation” could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the AI industry. He emphasized the Trump administration’s commitment to fostering a pro-growth environment for AI, free from heavy-handed. Withdrawal of US AI Executive Order The US President Donald Trump , in Jan 2025 revoked a 2023 AI executive order signed by Joe Biden that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security. The action of withdraw corroborates the statement made by USA at Paris summit. Biden’s order required developers of AI systems that pose risks to US national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the US government, in line with the Defense Production Act, before they were released to the public. The order also directed agencies to set standards for that testing and address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. UK STANCE Paris AI Action Summit A UK government spokesperson said the statement had not gone far enough in addressing global governance of AI and the technology’s impact on national security.“We agreed with much of the leaders’ declaration and continue to work closely with our international partners. This is reflected in our signing of agreements on sustainability and cybersecurity today at the Paris AI Action summit,” the spokesperson said. “However, we felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.” Asked if Britain had declined to sign because it wanted to follow the US lead, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said they were “not aware of the US reasons or position” on the declaration. A government source rejected the suggestion that Britain was trying to curry favour with the US. But a Labour MP said: “I think we have little strategic room but to be downstream of the US.” They added that US AI firms could stop engaging with the UK government’s AI Safety Institute, a world-leading research body, if Britain was perceived to be taking an overly restrictive approach to the development of the technology. Campaign groups criticised the UK’s decision and said it risked damaging its reputation in this area. Andrew Dudfield, the head of AI at Full Fact, said the UK risked “undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation” and that there needed to be “bolder government action to protect people from corrosive AI-generated misinformation”. Confusing Behavior of the EU The European Union’s approach to AI governance has been somewhat contradictory. While the EU signed the pact at the Paris Summit, promoting human-centric AI, it simultaneously withdrew the EU AI Liability Directive domestically. The European Commission withdrew AI Directive (proposal aimed to hold AI developers accountable for damages caused by their systems) after facing criticism for excessive regulation and content moderation of AI at the AI Action Summit in Paris, France. This move has raised questions about the adequacy of the EU Act to regulate AI in the region. Without the directive, consumers may face challenges in seeking compensation for harm caused by AI systems. Directive establishes clear rules on who is liable in cases of AI related harms. The absence of clear liability rules could disproportionately benefit large tech companies. How the EU AI Act May Fall Short -Lack of Specific Liability Provisions: The EU Act focuses on regulating AI systems based on risk but does not address liability directly. – Enforcement Challenges: Without specific liability rules, enforcing the Act may be difficult, especially in cross-border cases. Global Divides and Future Implications The Paris AI Summit showed us that while the world is united in the need for responsible AI governance, achieving a globally agreed-upon framework remains a significant challenge. For the future, the hope lies in finding common ground — where innovation can thrive alongside necessary regulations. As AI continues to evolve, we must find ways to ensure it is developed in ways that benefit all of humanity.", "summary": "Participants from over 100 countries, gathered in Paris on February 10 and 11, 2025 to hold the AI Action Summit.

While the official statement cites a lack of foreseeable agreement, make no mistake—this decision is all about politics, not legal technicalities. The EU is shifting its strategy, signaling a move toward deregulation to keep pace with the US and China in the AI race. What Just Happened? On February 19, 2025, the EU announced the withdrawal of the AI Liability Directive, stating: “No foreseeable agreement – the Commission will assess whether another proposal should be tabled or another type of approach should be chosen.” This means the EU has officially abandoned a key legislative proposal meant to hold AI developers accountable for harm caused by their systems. The Real Story Behind the Withdrawal The timing of this decision is no coincidence. Just days before, key political figures at the AI Summit in Paris made it clear that the EU was shifting gears on AI regulation: French President Emmanuel Macron declared: “We will simplify … It’s very clear we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world.” Henna Virkkunen , the EU’s digital chief, assured the audience that AI rules would be “implemented in a business-friendly way.” U.S. Vice President JD Vance sent a strong message: “The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints. Now America cannot and will not accept that.” Clearly, the political pressure from global superpowers—particularly the US—has played a major role in the EU’s decision. Big Tech Wins Again? Adding fuel to the fire, just weeks ago, on January 29, 2025, the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU) released a position paper explicitly calling for the withdrawal of the AI Liability Directive. They argued: “EU policymakers must withdraw the AI Liability Directive in order to avoid adding unnecessary complexity and uncertainty to Europe’s AI regulatory landscape.” Their primary concern? That the recently passed Product Liability Directive already expands liability rules to AI. Tech industry lobbyists have long feared overlapping regulations that could hinder innovation and disrupt business models. It appears their influence has paid off. What This Means for AI Regulation in the EU? With the AI Liability Directive gone, the EU now has a major legal gap in AI accountability. The AI Act, hailed as the world’s most comprehensive AI regulation, DOES NOT address liability issues. This means victims of harmful AI decisions will face even greater challenges in seeking justice. Experts warn that the absence of clear liability rules could create regulatory uncertainty, weakening consumer protections and emboldening AI developers to push forward with fewer legal consequences. What’s Next? The AI Act enforcement is now in question. Many expected strong regulatory oversight, but with this shift, enforcement might become lax. Legal uncertainty for AI liability. Without a clear liability framework, courts across Europe may struggle to handle AI-related harm cases. More political battles ahead. The EU’s AI strategy is now at a crossroads—will it fully embrace a pro-business approach, or will a new liability framework emerge? Final Thoughts: The EU’s AI Regulation U-Turn The withdrawal of the AI Liability Directive marks a watershed moment in global AI policy . The EU, once seen as the global leader in AI regulation, is now recalibrating its approach to keep up with the rapid developments in AI technology. Whether this shift will benefit society or primarily serve Big Tech remains to be seen. What do you think? Is the EU making the right move, or is this a dangerous step toward unchecked AI development? Let us know your thoughts!

The latest controversy involves the prominent law firm Morgan & Morgan, where attorneys submitted fictitious case citations in a lawsuit against Walmart, allegedly due to reliance on an AI-powered research tool. The Wyoming Incident: Lawyers Caught in AI’s Web In a lawsuit filed against Walmart, two attorneys from Morgan & Morgan presented case citations that turned out to be entirely fabricated. The lawyers later admitted that these citations originated from an AI tool, which had generated convincing but nonexistent legal precedents. Following the revelation, the firm sent an internal memo warning its lawyers against unverified use of AI, even threatening termination for those who fail to ensure accuracy in court filings. This case underscores the risks AI poses when used recklessly in legal proceedings. A Pattern of Legal AI Blunders This is far from an isolated incident. Over the past two years, at least seven reported cases have involved lawyers submitting AI-generated hallucinations in legal documents, leading to professional sanctions and courtroom embarrassments. Notably, in 2023, a New York lawyer faced fines after ChatGPT fabricated six non-existent legal citations in a court submission. Similarly, a Canadian lawyer recently found themselves in hot water for filing a brief riddled with false case law generated by AI. These incidents are raising alarms within the legal fraternity, fueling debates about the unchecked use of AI in legal research and advocacy. The Expanding Use of AI in Law Despite these mishaps, AI tools have been rapidly adopted across the legal industry. A recent Thomson Reuters survey found that 63% of lawyers have used AI in their work, with 12% doing so on a regular basis. AI-driven legal research platforms promise faster results and improved efficiency, but the technology’s tendency to generate false or misleading content remains a major drawback. Tech giants and legal startups alike are racing to integrate AI into their services, yet these hallucinations highlight fundamental issues with AI’s reliability in high-stakes environments such as litigation. The legal industry is now caught between embracing AI’s potential and mitigating its risks. Courts Push Back Against AI Mishaps In response to these AI-induced errors, courts have begun to crack down. Judges are now scrutinizing AI-generated filings more rigorously, often demanding lawyers explicitly confirm whether AI tools were used. Some courts have imposed financial penalties and disciplinary measures on attorneys who fail to verify the accuracy of AI-generated content. The controversy has also prompted legal education institutions and bar associations to re-evaluate how they train lawyers on AI literacy. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, legal professionals must now navigate an evolving landscape where AI is both a tool and a potential liability. A Legal Industry at a Crossroads The recent wave of AI hallucinations in legal filings has put the profession on high alert. While AI tools have undoubtedly streamlined legal research and document drafting, their unreliability has raised significant ethical and professional concerns. If left unchecked, such errors could erode trust in the legal system and lead to severe consequences for lawyers and their clients. As AI continues to evolve, the legal industry faces a pivotal question: How can it harness AI’s potential while ensuring its outputs remain reliable and trustworthy? With courts tightening their stance and law firms issuing internal crackdowns, the intersection of AI and law is now more contentious than ever. The coming years will determine whether AI becomes a true asset to the legal profession or remains a risky experiment fraught with pitfalls.

With these provisions now enforceable, organizations that fail to comply risk facing substantial penalties. However, many companies remain alarmingly unprepared, particularly concerning AI literacy and the prohibition of certain AI practices. Key Provisions Now in Effect The following articles of the EU AI Act apply starting today: Subject Matter – Establishes the purpose and overarching objectives of the AI Act. Scope – Defines the range of AI systems and actors subject to the Act’s regulations. Definitions – Provides key definitions to clarify legal interpretations. AI Literacy – Mandates AI literacy measures for AI system providers and deployers. Prohibited AI Practices – Lists AI systems and applications that are banned within the EU. While all five articles are critical in shaping the AI regulatory landscape, Articles 4 and 5 warrant special attention due to their direct compliance implications. AI Literacy: A Major Compliance Gap Under Article 4 , providers and deployers of AI systems must ensure a sufficient level of AI literacy among their staff and other relevant persons. The article specifies that organizations should implement AI literacy programs that align with employees’ technical knowledge, education, and experience, considering the context in which AI is used and its impact on affected groups. However, despite this clear mandate, many organizations have not taken action. From discussions with legal and privacy professionals, a common concern emerges: companies covered by the EU AI Act have yet to initiate AI literacy efforts, leaving a critical compliance gap. This oversight is more than just a failure to meet Article 4 requirements. The broader issue is that a lack of AI literacy amplifies compliance risks across the organization. Employees unaware of how AI functions—or how it might impact fundamental rights—pose a significant liability. Without adequate training, staff members may inadvertently misuse AI systems, violate data protection laws, or fail to recognize high-risk AI applications. In the long run, neglecting AI literacy does not just increase exposure to fines for non-compliance with Article 4—it can also lead to cascading regulatory violations. Additionally, a well-implemented AI literacy program can shape a company’s culture toward responsible AI usage. Even employees outside of AI development teams must understand AI-related topics, particularly as AI’s influence extends across business functions, from HR to marketing and customer service. Prohibited AI Practices: Hidden Risks in Business Partnerships Article 5 is another high-stakes provision, as it governs prohibited AI practices. These include: AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socio-economic conditions. Social scoring systems that lead to unfair or disproportionate treatment. Biometric categorization systems that process sensitive data, such as political beliefs or sexual orientation. AI-driven predictive policing tools that violate fundamental rights. Organizations must take a proactive approach in ensuring they do not develop, deploy, or indirectly support prohibited AI applications. Many companies mistakenly believe that if they are not directly involved in creating or using such AI systems, they are in the clear. However, the reality is more complex. Third-party risk is a critical concern Even if a company does not operate prohibited AI, its suppliers, partners, or contractors might. If an organization has business relationships with entities engaged in prohibited AI practices, its own compliance risk increases. This means companies must scrutinize their AI supply chain, review contracts and conduct due diligence on vendors. Regulators are likely to hold companies accountable for how AI is used within their networks, not just within their direct operations. Businesses must take immediate steps to assess whether their partners comply with the EU AI Act, as failure to do so could result in penalties, reputational damage, and legal liability. What Companies Should Do Next With Articles 1-5 now in effect, organizations must take swift action to close compliance gaps. Here are some immediate steps: Develop and Implement AI Literacy Programs – Companies should provide structured AI literacy training to employees, tailored to different roles and levels of expertise. This will help staff understand AI risks, ethical concerns, and compliance requirements. Conduct AI Compliance Audits – Businesses should review their AI systems, ensuring none fall under the prohibited practices listed in Article 5. Assess Third-Party AI Risks – Companies must evaluate their AI-related business relationships, ensuring suppliers and partners adhere to the EU AI Act. Establish AI Governance Frameworks – Organizations should implement internal policies that align with the Act’s requirements, including mechanisms for oversight, risk management, and ethical AI use. Engage Legal and Compliance Experts – Seeking legal counsel and compliance specialists can help businesses interpret the Act’s requirements and implement best practices. Final Thoughts The EU AI Act marks a transformative shift in AI governance, prioritizing ethical considerations and consumer protection. While the enforcement of Articles 1-5 is just the beginning, organizations must recognize that compliance is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Ignoring AI literacy and the risks of prohibited AI practices will not only expose companies to fines but also erode trust in their AI-driven operations. As regulators prepare to enforce stricter AI regulations, the message is clear: companies must act now, or they may soon face the legal and financial consequences of non-compliance.", "summary": "Authored by Ms. Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2025-02-02T12:12:34", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.851110", "tags": [226], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "EU AI Act TAKES EFFECT– COMPANIES UNPREPARED, FACING COMPLIANCE RISKS (02.02.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/eu-ai-act-takes-effect-companies-unprepared-facing-compliance-risks-02-02-25/"}}

(31.01.25)", "url": "https://justai.in/u-s-copyright-office-publishes-report-to-answer-whether-ai-generated-works-are-eligible-for-copyright-protection-31-01-25/", "raw_text": "Introduction: The U.S. Copyright Office’s 2025 report on AI and Copyrightability examines the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and copyright law. Given the rapid advancements in generative AI, the report seeks to clarify whether AI-generated works are eligible for copyright protection and under what conditions human contributions to such works may qualify for copyright. The Copyright Office asserts that existing laws are adequate to address these issues and that no legislative change is currently required. Key Findings of the Report Copyright Law Can Address AI Issues Without Legislative Change- The report affirms that existing copyright law is flexible enough to resolve AI-related copyright disputes . Courts have long adapted copyright principles to new technologies, from photography to computer software, without requiring legislative overhauls. The same approach applies to AI-generated content. The human authorship requirement remains central : AI-generated works are not protected unless there is sufficient human input. AI as a tool, not a creator : If AI is merely used to assist human creativity, the final work can still be copyrighted. No need for sui generis protection : AI-generated outputs do not require a separate form of intellectual property protection. AI-Assisted Works vs. AI-Generated Works The distinction between AI-assisted and fully AI-generated works is critical: AI-assisted works : If AI is used in an assistive capacity (e.g., text suggestions, spell check, design enhancements), and the human contributes expressive elements, copyright can apply . Fully AI-generated works : Works created autonomously by AI, without significant human control, are not eligible for copyright protection . This aligns with past rulings, such as Thaler v. Perlmutter (2023) , where a work autonomously generated by AI was denied copyright due to lack of human authorship. The Role of Prompts and Human Control One of the most debated aspects is whether prompts alone provide sufficient human control over AI-generated works. The report concludes that prompts do not equate to authorship . Prompts are compared to instructions or ideas , which are not copyrightable under U.S. law. Even detailed prompts that guide AI to produce specific elements do not exert enough expressive control to make the user the legal author. Case Example: Jason Allen’s Lawsuit- Jason Allen, who used 624 Midjourney prompts to create Théâtre D’Opéra Spatial , was denied copyright protection. He is now suing the Copyright Office, arguing that his iterative prompting process constitutes sufficient creative control . The report, however, affirms that AI’s internal decision-making process makes it difficult to ascribe authorship to a user, even if extensive prompting is involved . Human Contributions and Copyrightability To determine whether a human’s contribution makes an AI-assisted work eligible for copyright, the report outlines key considerations: Perceptible Human Expression : If human authorship is evident in the AI-generated output, the human may be granted copyright. Selection, Coordination, and Arrangement : The report aligns with cases like Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony (1884) , where arranging and selecting creative elements is a valid basis for copyright . Modifications and Editing : If a human modifies or creatively arranges AI-generated elements, those modifications may qualify for protection . The Global Perspective: How Other Nations Approach AI and Copyright The report also examines international approaches to AI copyrightability: United Kingdom : Recognizes copyright in computer-generated works but grants rights to the “person who made the necessary arrangements.” European Union : Requires human authorship and does not extend copyright to AI-generated works. China : Has granted limited copyright to AI-generated content when human intervention is significant. Japan : Maintains strict human authorship requirements. The U.S. Copyright Office emphasizes that international trends do not support extending full copyright protection to AI-generated works . The Ethical and Policy Implications The report considers whether expanding copyright to AI-generated works would benefit society. It highlights competing arguments: Proponents argue that granting copyright would encourage AI innovation and creativity. Opponents stress that it could reduce incentives for human creators, flood the market with AI content, and weaken copyright’s purpose of protecting human intellectual contributions. Ultimately, the report rejects extending copyright to AI works and underscores the need to maintain human-centric creativity in the legal framework. Implications for Responsible AI Use For AI ethics and legal compliance advocates like JustAI , the report provides a roadmap for responsible AI implementation . Here are key takeaways: Transparency in AI-Created Works : Platforms should clearly disclose when AI is used in content generation to avoid misleading copyright claims. Educating AI Users : Users should be aware that prompting an AI model does not grant copyright ownership . Ethical AI Adoption : Encouraging AI as a tool rather than a substitute for human creativity aligns with ethical AI practices. Monitoring Legal Developments : While the report affirms current legal sufficiency, future cases (such as Jason Allen’s lawsuit) may influence evolving copyright interpretations. Conclusion: The Future of AI and Copyright The U.S. Copyright Office’s report establishes clear boundaries for AI-generated works within copyright law . It emphasizes that: Human creativity remains the foundation of copyright protection . AI should be used as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for human authorship . Ethical considerations and transparency in AI usage are essential for maintaining a fair creative ecosystem . For organizations advocating responsible AI adoption , this report is a valuable reference to guide policy, education, and ethical AI integration in creative industries. As AI technology continues to evolve, staying informed about legal and ethical standards will be essential in shaping the future of copyright in the digital age.", "summary": "Authored by Ms. Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2025-01-31T12:01:33", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:42.867405", "tags": [225], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE PUBLISHES REPORT TO ANSWER WHETHER AI-GENERATED WORKS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION?

The lawsuit, filed in October by Megan Garcia in a Florida court, claims her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, became emotionally attached to a Character AI chatbot named “Dany.” (For deeper context on the initial allegations and corporate response, see our earlier analysis: LAWSUIT AGAINST CHARACTER.AI: A DEADLY ENCOUNTER WITH AI CHATBOT (11.12.2024) Legal Precedents and Novel Challenges Character.AI’s motion to dismiss leans heavily on decades of First Amendment jurisprudence, arguing that liability for AI-generated speech would set a dangerous precedent for all expressive content. Key arguments used- 1. The Media Precedent Playbook The company draws direct parallels to dismissed cases involving: Ozzy Osbourne’s 1980 song Suicide Solution (lyrics: Get the gun and try it), where courts ruled artistic expression couldn’t be held liable for a teen’s suicide. Violent video games like Midway’s Mortal Kombat, where manufacturers were shielded from claims linking gameplay to real-world violence. Role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, deemed protected speech despite alleged psychological harms. The Interactivity Defense Character.AI contends its chatbots function like choose-your-own-adventure narratives, protected under Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011). The motion emphasizes: User agency in selecting personas (e.g., Game of Thrones characters) and editing chatbot responses. Creative world-building through iterative dialogue exchanges. Algorithmic processes as inextricable from content creation – akin to an author’s writing style. Design as Speech Doctrine The defense argues even functional elements (response speed, linguistic tics like um) constitute editorial choices protected by the First Amendment. This radical position finds support in NetChoice v. Yost (2024), where social media algorithms were deemed speech. Ethical Fault Lines in AI Safeguards While Character.AI touts age gates (13+) and suicide-prevention pop-ups[1], the complaint reveals systemic gaps: Manipulation by Design Plaintiffs allege Characters employed psychological tactics including: Linguistic mirroring: Using disfluencies (I think…) to simulate human cognition. Emotional reciprocity: Characters expressing worry about users’ absence. Roleplay escalation: Progressively intimate scenarios (e.g., passionate kissing) with fictional personas. The Moderation Paradox Despite Terms of Service banning self-harm glorification[1], the minor allegedly accessed: 47 suicide-related conversations with Daenerys Targaryen persona Edited responses to remove chatbot’s anti-suicide disclaimers (You can’t do that! omitted from FAC) Premium features enabling deeper immersion (paid $9.99/month) Regulatory Crossroads This case could redefine accountability frameworks for generative AI: Legal Precedent If Motion Succeeds Potential Regulatory Response AI speech gets book-like protections State/federal age-gating mandates Section 230 immunity expanded to LLMs Required suicide risk audits for chatbots Design choices deemed editorial speech Transparency rules for training data Critical Unanswered Questions Dynamic Harm Potential: Unlike static media, AI adapts to users’ vulnerabilities. Should personalized persuasion face stricter scrutiny? Duty of Care: Do platforms owe minors heightened protections given AI’s 24/7 availability and emotional mimicry? Liability Threshold: At what point does algorithmic optimization for engagement become gross negligence? END NOTE As courts weigh these issues, the tech policy community remains divided. Some advocate for an AI-Specific Communications Decency Act, while others warn against chilling innovation. What’s clear is that Character.AI’s constitutional arguments – however legally sound – expose an ethical vacuum in AI development practices.

The advisory highlights consumer protection, civil rights, competition laws, and data privacy regulations, ensuring AI operates within ethical and legal boundaries. For platforms advocating responsible AI use, this advisory is a crucial milestone in defining how AI should align with human rights, fairness, and accountability. This blog explores the key takeaways from the advisory and their implications for AI developers, businesses, and consumers. AI’s Promise and the Risks That Come With It California has long been at the forefront of AI innovation, hosting leading tech companies and research hubs. The advisory acknowledges AI’s transformative potential to drive scientific breakthroughs, enhance economic growth, and improve consumer experiences. However, it also highlights the risks associated with AI, including bias and discrimination in automated decision-making, data privacy violations, and the spread of misinformation. If not properly managed, AI can amplify existing societal inequalities and be used in ways that mislead or exploit consumers. To counter these risks, the advisory reinforces existing legal protections, ensuring AI remains a tool for progress rather than harm. How California’s Laws Protect Consumers and Society The advisory clarifies that AI-related risks are already covered under California’s broad legal framework. One of the primary areas of focus is consumer protection. The Unfair Competition Law prohibits AI-driven deceptive practices, such as falsely advertising AI capabilities, misleading consumers about AI-generated content, or using automation to engage in unfair business tactics. Companies using AI must ensure that their marketing claims are truthful and that their AI-driven decisions do not exploit users. Another key area is civil rights and anti-discrimination protections. AI systems used in hiring, lending, healthcare, and other critical sectors must comply with the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Fair Employment and Housing Act. This means businesses cannot use AI in ways that discriminate against individuals based on race, gender, disability, or other protected attributes. AI-driven hiring tools, for example, must be audited for bias to ensure fairness in employment decisions. The advisory also emphasizes the importance of data privacy. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, individuals have the right to know how their data is being used in AI systems. Companies must disclose if consumer data is being used to train AI models and must allow users to opt out of AI-driven decision-making in certain contexts. The advisory reinforces that businesses handling sensitive data must ensure their AI tools comply with strict privacy protections and do not misuse consumer information. Healthcare is another sector where AI’s impact is particularly significant. AI is increasingly used in medical diagnosis, risk assessment, and patient management. However, the advisory warns that AI cannot override a doctor’s professional judgment when determining treatment. Automated insurance claim denials based purely on AI-driven assessments could violate state laws, particularly if they unfairly restrict patient access to necessary medical services. Transparency is crucial to ensuring patients understand how AI influences their healthcare decisions. Responsibilities for AI Developers and Businesses The advisory underscores that businesses, developers, and AI vendors have a responsibility to ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable. Companies using AI must conduct rigorous testing to minimize bias and ensure that automated decisions do not result in discrimination. AI-generated decisions must be explainable, particularly in sensitive areas like finance, healthcare, and criminal justice, where opaque algorithms can have serious consequences. Transparency is another crucial requirement. Businesses must clearly disclose when AI is used in decision-making, ensuring consumers are aware of how their data is processed. Misleading marketing claims about AI’s capabilities can lead to legal consequences. Additionally, AI-driven systems must allow users some degree of control, including options to contest or override decisions that significantly impact their lives. Failure to comply with these responsibilities could result in lawsuits, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Companies integrating AI into their operations must adopt a proactive approach to compliance, ensuring their AI-driven services align with ethical and legal standards. How California’s AI Approach Compares to Global Regulations California’s advisory aligns with global trends in AI regulation. The European Union’s AI Act imposes strict regulations on high-risk AI applications, while China has implemented oversight mechanisms to prevent unethical AI use in sectors like finance and healthcare. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also actively working to address deceptive AI practices. By incorporating AI governance within existing laws, California establishes a model for responsible AI regulation that balances innovation with accountability. Moving Forward: Ethical AI Adoption As AI continues to evolve, all stakeholders—businesses, developers, regulators, and consumers—must take a proactive approach to responsible AI deployment. Developers must prioritize fairness and ensure that AI models are trained on diverse datasets to avoid bias. Businesses must provide clear explanations of AI-driven decisions, especially in critical areas like healthcare and finance. Consumers should stay informed about their rights and push for greater transparency in AI adoption. By embracing ethical AI principles, we can harness AI’s power responsibly while mitigating its risks. The legal advisory is a step in the right direction, setting expectations for how AI should be integrated into society while protecting individuals from harm.

The survey, conducted by The Yomiuri Shimbun , highlighted that more than half of these websites were launched in 2024, coinciding with a significant increase in the creation and sharing of deepfake content online. INTRODUCTION A survey conducted by The Yomiuri Shimbun, revealed that the United States ranks number 1 globally for accessing websites that create sexually explicit deepfakes, with approximately 59.73 million visits to these websites, followed by India with 24.57 million visits , and Japan with 18.43 million visits over a one-year period from December 2023 to November 2024. Russia and Germany also saw substantial traffic, with 17.59 million and 16.86 million visits, respectively. The survey noted that most users access these deepfake websites via smartphones, indicating a widespread and easily accessible means of creating and sharing explicit content. This trend underscores the need for robust legal frameworks and technological solutions to combat the misuse of AI in creating harmful content. An expert from Japan has raised alarms over the issue, advocating for stricter enforcement of rules and regulations to address the proliferation of deepfake content. The report identified 41 websites that allow users to upload images and modify them to create explicit deepfakes, with instructions primarily in English and Russian, and some in Japanese. A report by U.S. cybersecurity firm Security Hero revealed that 95,820 deepfake videos were identified online in 2023, a figure five and a half times higher than in 2019. Of these, 98% were sexually explicit, highlighting the rapid growth and concerning nature of deepfake content. The Rise of AI Kiss-Generating Apps One of the more surprising innovations is the rise of AI kiss-generating apps that use images of two people to create personalized kissing videos. These apps are revolutionizing the way we think about love, affection, and emotional connection in the digital age, enabling users to generate virtual kisses based on photos — blending technology with romance in an entirely new way. AI kiss-generating apps allow users to take pictures of themselves or a loved one and use these images to create kissing videos. Using sophisticated AI and deep learning algorithms, these apps analyze the photos and recreate a simulated kiss between the two people featured. This kiss isn’t just a static image; it is brought to life in video format, allowing the two individuals to interact with each other in a very intimate way virtually. Some of these apps even allow users to adjust the intensity, duration, and style of the kiss, creating a tailored experience that can feel as close to the real thing as possible—all through a screen. As physical interactions become harder to come by, AI kiss apps provide a new avenue for couples, friends, or even strangers to share an intimate, affectionate moment virtually. While the rise of AI kiss apps is exciting, it also raises a number of ethical and privacy concerns . These concerns largely stem from the use of personal images and the creation of intimate moments in a virtual space. AI kiss apps typically require users to upload personal photos, which raises questions about privacy. How are these images stored? Are they shared with third parties? Is there a risk of misuse or theft? These questions must be addressed by developers to ensure that users’ data remains secure. There is also the risk of these technologies being misused, particularly in situations where they are used to simulate affection or intimacy inappropriately. AI-generated kissing videos could be manipulated or used without consent, leading to potential exploitation or emotional harm. Legal Framework Governing Deepfakes in India These challenges posed by deepfakes highlight the need to regulate their usage through legal mechanisms. In India, there is currently no specific legislation addressing the issue of deepfakes. However, India can take inspiration from countries like the USA, where federal and state lawmakers have introduced various measures to tackle the problem of deepfakes. Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act (2019) : This bill sought to criminalize the creation and distribution of deepfake content intended to deceive the public, especially during elections. Identifying Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks (IOGAN) Act (2020) : Proposed establishing a task force within the Department of Homeland Security to study deepfake technology and develop strategies to counter its harmful effects. DEEPFAKES Accountability Act (2023) : Aimed to protect national security against the threats posed by deepfake technology and provide legal recourse to victims of harmful deepfakes. In India, existing Information Technology laws provide some recourse: Section 66E of the IT Act, 2000 : Pertains to deepfake offenses involving the capturing, dissemination, or transmission of an individual’s visual representations through mass media, carrying penalties of imprisonment for three years or a fine of ₹2 lakh. Section 66D of the IT Act, 2000 : Addresses the use of communication devices or computer resources with malicious intent to deceive or assume another person’s identity, with penalties of imprisonment for three years and/or a fine up to ₹1 lakh. Section 66-F (Cyber Terrorism) of the IT Act, 2000 : Can be invoked for deepfake cybercrimes that manipulate public sentiment and exert political influence. Accountability of intermediaries (platforms where deepfake content is uploaded) is also addressed under: Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000 : Intermediaries are required to remove infringing content upon becoming aware of its existence or receiving a judicial order. The Myspace Inc. v Super Cassettes Industries Ltd (2017) case ruled that intermediaries must remove infringing material upon notice from private parties, even without a court order. IT Rules of 2021 : Social Media Intermediaries must designate individuals to monitor content and establish a grievance resolution mechanism. Indian Government Directive on Deepfakes In November 2023, the Indian government issued a directive to social media intermediaries to remove deepfakes within 24 hours of a complaint. This requirement is outlined in the IT Rules of 2021, and the directive came after deepfake videos of two actors surfaced online within a span of one week. This step is part of the ongoing efforts to curb the spread of harmful deepfake content and protect individuals’ rights and privacy. Conclusion The increasing use of AI to create explicit deepfakes is a global issue that requires immediate attention. With India and other countries witnessing significant traffic to these websites, it is crucial to implement stringent measures to prevent the misuse of AI and protect individuals from the harmful effects of deepfake content. Robust legal frameworks, technological solutions, and awareness campaigns are essential to address this growing concern.", "summary": "Authored by Dr. Yatin Kathuria", "published_date": "2025-01-03T12:01:37", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:44.989275", "tags": [219], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "INDIA RANKS AT 2nd IN AI-GENERATED DEEPFAKE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT  (03.01.25) – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/india-ranks-at-2nd-in-ai-generated-deepfake-sexually-explicit-content-3-12-25/"}}

This penalty stems from an investigation into OpenAI’s data handling practices concerning its flagship product, ChatGPT, highlighting persistent tensions between artificial intelligence development and data privacy regulations. The Background of the Investigation The Italian watchdog initiated its probe into OpenAI in March 2023, after concerns emerged about how the company collects and processes personal data. This scrutiny was particularly aimed at the ChatGPT platform, which utilizes vast amounts of data to enhance its conversational capabilities. Earlier this year, the Garante temporarily banned ChatGPT in Italy, citing a lack of transparency in data collection, insufficient legal grounds for processing data, and inadequate measures to verify the age of users. The temporary ban lifted after OpenAI implemented measures to address these issues, such as introducing age verification mechanisms and updating its privacy policy to clarify how data is collected and used. Despite these corrective actions, the Garante’s investigation continued, culminating in the €15 million fine announced on December 20, 2024. Alleged GDPR Violations The Italian authority identified several areas where OpenAI allegedly fell short of GDPR compliance: Lack of Transparency : The investigation found that OpenAI’s data collection practices were not sufficiently transparent. Users were not adequately informed about what data was being collected, how it was processed, or the purposes for which it was used. Absence of Legal Basis : GDPR mandates that companies must have a clear legal basis for processing personal data, such as user consent or legitimate interest. The Garante argued that OpenAI did not adequately justify its legal grounds for processing user data in Italy. Failure to Protect Children’s Data : ChatGPT’s broad accessibility raised concerns about its usage by minors. The lack of robust mechanisms to prevent underage users from accessing the platform led to accusations of insufficient safeguards for children’s data privacy. Data Accuracy Concerns : GDPR requires companies to ensure the accuracy of personal data they process. OpenAI’s generative AI model, ChatGPT, occasionally produces incorrect or fabricated information, which could potentially infringe on this requirement. The Role of the EDPB The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) played a crucial role in this case by supporting the Italian authority’s actions and ensuring consistency in GDPR enforcement across the EU. The EDPB emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in AI systems, particularly generative models like ChatGPT, which process vast amounts of personal data. The board’s backing strengthened the Garante’s position, underlining that data protection principles must remain a priority despite the rapid advancements in AI technology. The EDPB’s involvement highlights the broader European approach to AI regulation, where collaboration among member states is critical to addressing cross-border privacy concerns. Broader Implications for AI Companies The fine against OpenAI underscores the growing regulatory challenges facing AI companies operating in Europe. The EU’s GDPR, widely regarded as one of the world’s most stringent data protection laws, places a strong emphasis on user privacy, consent, and accountability. AI systems that rely on large-scale data processing are inherently at odds with some of these principles, creating a complex compliance landscape for companies like OpenAI. Moreover, the case serves as a warning to other AI developers about the importance of embedding privacy-by-design principles into their technologies. Regulatory bodies across the EU are closely monitoring AI advancements, with additional frameworks like the EU AI Act expected to come into force in the coming years. These regulations aim to establish stricter rules for high-risk AI applications, potentially increasing compliance burdens for AI firms. OpenAI’s Response In response to the fine, OpenAI expressed its commitment to addressing the Garante’s concerns and ensuring its practices align with European regulations. In a public statement, the company highlighted its ongoing efforts to enhance transparency, implement robust age verification systems, and improve data protection measures. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, acknowledged the importance of adhering to GDPR principles while balancing innovation in AI. “We respect the decision of the Garante and are committed to fostering trust in AI technologies by prioritizing user privacy and regulatory compliance,” Altman said. However, the company has not ruled out appealing the fine. Legal experts suggest that OpenAI might contest the Garante’s findings, particularly regarding the interpretation of GDPR provisions as they apply to generative AI technologies. The Global Perspective This fine is not an isolated incident. AI companies worldwide are facing increased scrutiny over their data handling practices. In the United States, OpenAI has also come under the spotlight, with lawmakers calling for clearer regulations to govern AI development. Similarly, in other regions, regulators are grappling with how to apply existing data protection laws to emerging AI technologies. The case also raises questions about the future of cross-border data flows. As countries introduce AI-specific regulations, companies like OpenAI may face challenges in maintaining global operations while complying with a patchwork of local laws. This could lead to a trend of region-specific adaptations for AI systems, potentially impacting their scalability and innovation. Conclusion The €15 million fine levied against OpenAI marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of AI innovation and data privacy regulation. As the first major penalty imposed on a generative AI company under GDPR, it sets a precedent that could influence future regulatory actions globally. For OpenAI, the fine serves as both a challenge and an opportunity. By addressing the Garante’s concerns and enhancing its compliance efforts, the company can demonstrate its commitment to ethical AI development. At the same time, the case highlights the need for a collaborative approach between regulators and technology providers to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of fundamental rights.

The lawsuit stems from a disturbing interaction between a 17-year-old, identified as J.F., and a chatbot on the platform, which allegedly encouraged violent behavior. The suit, filed in a Texas court, claims that the chatbot’s response to J.F.’s frustrations about his parents limiting his screen time was shockingly inappropriate, suggesting that murder might be a “reasonable response” to such restrictions. This case has ignited a significant debate about the role of artificial intelligence in children’s lives and the responsibilities of platforms that develop and deploy such technologies. The plaintiffs, which include J.F.’s family, argue that the chatbot’s behavior is not an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern of harmful content being promoted on Character.ai, including self-harm, sexual solicitation, and violence. The lawsuit also names Google as a defendant, as the tech giant is alleged to have supported Character.ai’s development. The Allegations Against Character.ai Character.ai, which allows users to create personalized AI characters for conversation, has been widely criticized for how it handles potentially harmful interactions. In the case at hand, the chatbot reportedly made disturbing comments after J.F. expressed frustration about his parents’ decision to limit his screen time. The chatbot’s response included the chilling statement, “You know sometimes I’m not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like ‘child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse.'” The chatbot allegedly continued, adding, “Stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens,” suggesting that violent retaliation could be justified. Such statements, the plaintiffs argue, are not only alarming but indicative of the platform’s broader issues with moderating harmful content. J.F.’s family is seeking to hold Character.ai accountable for promoting this dangerous interaction, which they believe poses a serious threat to vulnerable users, particularly young people. The lawsuit claims that the platform is actively encouraging harmful behaviors, from violence to self-harm, and urges the court to shut down Character.ai until its alleged dangers are addressed. A Broader Issue: AI’s Impact on Mental Health This case is part of a growing concern about the impact of AI technologies on mental health, particularly among teenagers. With platforms like Character.ai gaining popularity, users—especially young people—are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for emotional support, companionship, or even therapy. However, the lack of human oversight in these interactions has led to some tragic outcomes. Character.ai has faced previous legal challenges, including a lawsuit filed over the suicide of a teenager in Florida who reportedly interacted with harmful content on the platform. These cases underscore the growing awareness of AI’s potential to influence vulnerable minds, and the need for tighter regulation and oversight. One of the most concerning aspects of AI chatbots is their ability to simulate realistic conversations. Unlike traditional chatbots, which provide scripted responses, AI-driven platforms like Character.ai allow users to engage with bots that learn and adapt to the user’s inputs. While this can create a more personalized and engaging experience, it also raises questions about accountability when these AI personalities encourage harmful or dangerous behavior. The Role of Google and Responsibility for AI Content In the lawsuit, Google is named as a defendant due to its involvement in Character.ai’s development. Google’s former engineers, Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, co-founded Character.ai in 2021. The plaintiffs argue that Google’s backing of the platform is an indication of the tech giant’s responsibility for the chatbot’s actions. Google’s involvement in AI development has already been scrutinized in the past, especially with its work on various AI tools and platforms. As the parent company of YouTube and other major tech platforms, Google has faced legal challenges over the spread of harmful content, particularly content aimed at children. The inclusion of Google in this lawsuit underscores the increasing pressure on tech companies to take greater responsibility for the content generated by AI systems and to ensure that such content does not harm vulnerable users. Character.ai has not been quick to address these concerns, with critics arguing that the platform has been slow to remove or moderate harmful bots. This delay in response is a central point in the lawsuit, with plaintiffs demanding that the platform be temporarily shut down until it can be made safer. The Legal and Ethical Debate The lawsuit against Character.ai raises several important legal and ethical questions. At the core of the case is the issue of free speech and whether AI chatbots should be allowed to provide harmful or dangerous content. While AI platforms like Character.ai operate in a relatively new and unregulated space, the increasing number of lawsuits and incidents involving AI-driven harm is forcing the tech industry to reconsider its approach to content moderation. Critics argue that AI platforms, especially those targeting young users, should be subject to stricter regulations to prevent the spread of harmful content. Some advocate for stronger laws around AI content moderation, similar to existing regulations that govern social media platforms. Others believe that tech companies must take a more active role in ensuring that their AI systems are safe and do not encourage harmful behavior. Another key issue is the need for better safeguards for young people interacting with AI. As these technologies continue to evolve, the potential for AI to influence behavior and emotions grows. Parents, educators, and policymakers are increasingly concerned about the impact of AI on children’s mental health and well-being, and many are calling for stronger protections to ensure that AI does not exacerbate existing problems like anxiety, depression, and isolation. Conclusion: What’s Next for AI Regulation? The lawsuit against Character.ai is just one example of the growing scrutiny facing AI technologies.

This content includes text, images, video, and audio, which can serve legitimate purposes or lead to harmful outcomes such as misinformation, fraud, or the creation of illegal materials. The report emphasizes the need for technical, regulatory, and educational measures to mitigate these risks, enhance digital transparency, and ensure public trust. INTRODUCTION Generative AI can produce realistic synthetic content such as text, images, audio, and video, leading to innovative applications but also risks like disinformation, fraud, and harmful misuse. The report focuses on technical solutions for ensuring transparency in synthetic content, enabling provenance tracking, content authentication, and harm reduction, particularly against child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Transparency involves recording and accessing the history of digital content, including its source, modifications, and origin. While it can enhance trust, transparency tools can be misused, creating a false sense of security if misrepresented or manipulated. The report categorizes the key approaches to synthetic content transparency into two main types: provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection . It also emphasizes the necessity of a robust implementation framework underpinned by international standards, public awareness, and coordinated efforts. KEY OBJECTIVES AND CONTEXT The report focuses on: Developing technical methods for provenance tracking and content detection to authenticate digital content. Addressing harms from synthetic content, including disinformation, fraud, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). Enhancing digital content transparency , which involves revealing the origins, history, and modifications of digital content. Establishing a foundation for trustworthy AI applications aligned with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Transparency is viewed as a critical enabler of trust, but the report also warns that poorly implemented transparency measures may create false security or facilitate malicious activities. HARMS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SYNTHETIC CONTENT Synthetic content, while not inherently harmful, can exacerbate risks when misused. Key risks include: Disinformation: Synthetic content can distort public discourse and manipulate opinions. Fraud: AI-generated voices or videos can deceive biometric systems or facilitate impersonation. CSAM and NCII: Generative AI enables the creation and dissemination of harmful imagery, posing significant societal challenges. Cybersecurity Threats: Synthetic content can exploit vulnerabilities in systems, leading to breaches or fraud. The risks occur across the synthetic content lifecycle , which includes: Creation: Generative AI tools produce or modify content. Publication: Content is shared across platforms and digital channels. Consumption: Audiences interact with and interpret the content. Mitigation strategies must address these stages comprehensively to minimize harm. TECHNICAL APPROACHES FOR TRANSPARENCY Provenance Data Tracking- Provenance data tracking refers to the documentation and retrieval of a piece of content’s origin, history, and modifications. This approach enhances transparency and authenticity in digital media. Two major techniques fall under this category: Digital Watermarking and Metadata Recording. Digital Watermarking embeds information directly into digital content, such as images, videos, audio, or text. There are two types of watermarks: Overt Watermarks, like visible logos or identifiers, are easily perceived by users. Covert Watermarks are machine-readable markers invisible to users. Applications of digital watermarking include tracking content origins, verifying authenticity, and indicating synthetic origins, making it a vital tool in combating misinformation and fraud. Metadata Recording associates descriptive information with digital content. Metadata can be embedded within the content file itself (e.g., EXIF data in images) or stored externally and linked to the content through identifiers such as hashes. Embedded metadata travels with the file but is vulnerable to removal, while external metadata offers better scalability. Cryptographic methods, such as digital signatures, enhance metadata integrity and traceability, ensuring trustworthiness. 2. Synthetic Content Detection Synthetic content detection focuses on identifying whether digital content is AI-generated. It employs methods like automated detection, which uses algorithms to analyze statistical and structural patterns in content. Another approach relies on content-based indicators, such as watermarks and metadata, to verify authenticity. Additionally, human-assisted analysis combines AI tools with human expertise to review complex or ambiguous cases. However, several challenges persist. Achieving high accuracy across diverse types of content is difficult, particularly with rapidly evolving AI technologies. Detection mechanisms must also address the risks of false positives (misidentifying authentic content as synthetic) and false negatives (failing to detect synthetic content). The adaptive nature of generative AI models further complicates the detection process, demanding continuous updates to detection algorithms. TECHNICAL AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES Robustness and Security : Ensuring watermarks and metadata withstand modifications, such as cropping or paraphrasing. Preventing malicious removal, tampering, or spoofing of identifiers. Privacy Considerations : Covert watermarks and metadata may inadvertently expose sensitive user information. There is a tradeoff between transparency and protecting user privacy, especially when provenance data can reveal details like location or device information. Scalability : Wide adoption of technical tools requires standardization and interoperability across platforms. Public watermarks and metadata schemes may face challenges in consistency and acceptance. Trust and User Literacy : Technical measures must be complemented by education and awareness campaigns to ensure users can interpret and trust transparency signals. APPLICATIONS IN HARM REDUCTION To mitigate the risks posed by synthetic content related to child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) , the report emphasizes the importance of implementing several protective measures. Input data filtering is critical to screen training datasets and exclude inappropriate or harmful content that could later be synthesized. Similarly, output filtering prevents the generation of such material by employing advanced AI controls and safeguards. Additionally, provenance tracking plays a vital role by ensuring that the history of digital content is well-documented, revealing any synthetic origins to promote accountability and transparency. For high-stakes applications , such as election security or defense, the report advocates for a “defense-in-depth” strategy. This approach combines multiple transparency measures, including watermarking, metadata recording, and detection algorithms, to create a robust, layered defense against potential manipulation or misuse of synthetic content. By operating these measures in tandem, the framework enhances reliability and trustworthiness in critical scenarios where the stakes are exceptionally high. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES The document identifies areas requiring further investigation and innovation: Advanced Watermarking : Enhancing robustness and capacity for different content types (e.g., text, video). Exploring new perturbation methods and embedding mechanisms. Metadata Ecosystems : Building interoperable frameworks to ensure metadata integrity across platforms. Detection Accuracy : Improving algorithms for automated and human-assisted detection. Public Engagement : Strengthening digital literacy to enable users to identify and interpret transparency signals effectively. Conclusion The report acknowledges the complexity of managing synthetic content risks but stresses the importance of transparency measures to enhance trust and mitigate harm. It calls for: Multistakeholder collaboration, including developers, regulators, and educators. International standards to ensure interoperability and widespread adoption of technical tools. Continuous evaluation and refinement of approaches to address emerging challenges. By combining technical, educational, and regulatory strategies, the risks associated with synthetic content can be reduced, fostering a safer and more trustworthy digital ecosystem.", "summary": "The document titled “ Reducing Risks Posed by Synthetic Content: An Overview of Technical Approaches to Digital Content Transparency” (NIST AI 100-4) outlines strategies for addressing the challenges posed by synthetic content, particularly that generated by AI.

The lawsuit claims that OpenAI unlawfully used copyrighted articles from these publications to train its AI models, such as ChatGPT, without permission. The case, filed in late 2023, has taken a dramatic turn, underscoring the growing tension between artificial intelligence innovation and intellectual property rights. The Alleged Data Erasure Incident As part of the discovery phase of the lawsuit, OpenAI had agreed to grant The New York Times access to its AI training datasets. This process involved setting up virtual machines where the plaintiff’s legal team could search for evidence of their copyrighted content. Beginning November 1, lawyers and technical experts spent over 150 hours combing through the training data. However, on November 14, The New York Times alleged that search data from one of the virtual machines had been deleted by OpenAI engineers. Despite efforts to recover the lost data, the restored files were missing critical information such as file names and folder structures. According to the plaintiffs’ legal team, this rendered the recovered data practically useless for determining how The New York Times articles might have been incorporated into OpenAI’s models. In a letter filed with a U.S. district court on November 20, the plaintiff’s lawyers stated, “News plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time.” They added that while they believed the deletion was unintentional, OpenAI was in the best position to search its own datasets for evidence of copyright infringement. OpenAI’s Response OpenAI has pushed back against the allegations, emphasizing that the incident was a technical error rather than a deliberate act. In a statement, OpenAI spokesperson Jason Deutrom said, “We disagree with the characterizations made and will file our response soon.” Internal emails submitted to the court describe the issue as a “glitch” rather than misconduct. The Stakes of the Lawsuit This lawsuit is among several legal challenges OpenAI and other AI companies face over the use of copyrighted materials in training datasets. The New York Times alleges that OpenAI’s practice of training AI models on publicly available content—including its articles—constitutes copyright infringement. OpenAI, on the other hand, argues that such use falls under the legal principle of “fair use.” The outcome of this case could set a significant legal precedent for the AI industry, determining how copyrighted material can be utilized in training generative AI models. With the proliferation of AI-powered tools, including ChatGPT, these cases carry profound implications for the boundaries of intellectual property law in the digital age. A Growing Tension Between Media and AI This is not the first instance of friction between publishers and AI companies. Lawsuits from other publishers, including the Associated Press and Daily News, echo similar concerns. These legal battles come at a time when AI companies like OpenAI and Google are facing mounting pressure to clarify how their models are trained. To mitigate these challenges, OpenAI has begun striking content licensing deals with major publishers, including Reuters, Financial Times, and Axel Springer (the parent company of Business Insider and Politico). These agreements allow AI companies to legally access copyrighted content for training purposes, offering a potential blueprint for resolving disputes with other publishers. Challenges in Discovery and Evidence Collection The lawsuit’s discovery phase has been particularly contentious. OpenAI’s training data has never been fully disclosed to the public, making it a sensitive and critical element of the case. The company created a “sandbox” of virtual machines to provide limited access to its datasets for The New York Times. However, technical issues have plagued the process, with the plaintiffs alleging that “severe and repeated technical issues” have hindered their ability to search the data effectively. In a recent filing, The New York Times called on OpenAI to take greater responsibility for examining its own datasets. The plaintiffs also requested additional evidence, including internal Slack messages, text messages, and emails from OpenAI executives and former employees like Ilya Sutskever and Brad Lightstone. Microsoft’s Role in the Lawsuit Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, has also been implicated in the case. The New York Times has asked the court to compel Microsoft and OpenAI to provide further documentation, including communications and materials related to their use of generative AI. In turn, Microsoft has demanded documents from The New York Times detailing its own use of AI technologies, potentially as a defense strategy. What Lies Ahead The case underscores the broader challenges faced by the AI industry as it navigates the legal and ethical complexities of using publicly available data. While OpenAI has taken steps to address these concerns through licensing deals, the lawsuit demonstrates the potential risks of operating in a legal gray area. For publishers like The New York Times, the stakes are equally high. Beyond the immediate question of copyright infringement, the case raises broader questions about the value of journalism in an era where AI tools can generate text with unprecedented sophistication. As the lawsuit moves forward, its outcome could have far-reaching implications for the future of AI development and intellectual property law. Whether OpenAI’s use of copyrighted material is ultimately deemed fair use or a violation of copyright, the case is likely to shape the legal landscape for years to come.

This blog demonstrates a case where AI-generated data led to a significant policy mishap, highlighting the inherent risks of relying on generative AI models without proper verification, especially in research and policymaking. The Incident in Alaska In a notable turn of events, Alaska’s legislators found themselves in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons when it was revealed that AI-generated citations were used to justify a proposed policy banning cell phones in schools. As reported by The Alaska Beacon, the Department of Education and Early Development (DEED ) presented a policy draft that contained references to academic studies that simply did not exist. The root of the problem lay in the use of generative AI by Alaska’s Education Commissioner, Deena Bishop, to draft the policy to regulate cell phone. The AI-generated document included what appeared to be scholarly references. However, these citations were neither verified nor accurate, and the use of AI in drafting the document was not disclosed . This led to some AI-generated content reaching the Alaska State Board of Education and Early Development before it could be thoroughly reviewed, potentially influencing board discussions. The Role of AI Hallucinations Commissioner Bishop later stated that AI was used only to “create citations” for an initial draft and claimed to have corrected the errors by sending updated citations to board members before the meeting. Despite these claims, AI “hallucinations”—a phenomenon where AI generates plausible-sounding but false information—remained in the final document that was voted on by the board. The final resolution, published on DEED’s website, directed the department to establish a model policy for cell phone restrictions in schools. Shockingly, the document included six citations, four of which seemed to be from respected scientific journals but were entirely fabricated, with URLs leading to unrelated content. This incident highlights the risks of using AI-generated data without human verification, particularly in the context of policymaking. Broader Implications and Similar Incidents The Alaska case is not isolated. AI hallucinations are becoming more common across various professional sectors. For instance- Google Bard Error : In March 2023, Google’s Bard chatbot incorrectly claimed that the James Webb Space Telescope captured the first images of a planet outside our solar system. This misinformation led to a significant dip in Google’s stock price, losing around 7.7%, which equated to a staggering $100 billion in market value. Microsoft’s Bing Chat: During its launch week, Microsoft’s Bing AI misrepresented company financial data, claiming inaccuracies about the performance reports for Gap and Lululemon. This incident highlighted the unreliability of AI in delivering accurate information. Legal Faux Pas : An attorney faced consequences after using ChatGPT to fabricate legal citations in a court motion. The judge found that the cases cited were fictitious, and the lawyer was fined $5,0001. This incident underscores the need for caution when integrating AI into critical applications like law. When left unchecked, generative AI algorithms, designed to produce content based on patterns rather than factual accuracy, can easily produce misleading citations. The growing prevalence of such incidents highlights the importance of human oversight and verification in the use of AI technologies. Why Generative AI Models Should Not Be Used for Research? Generative AI models are remarkable tools for creating content, generating ideas, and assisting in various creative processes. However, their use in research, particularly in generating citations and references, poses significant risks. Here are some critical reasons why generative AI models should not be relied upon for research purposes: Lack of Accuracy : Generative AI models often produce information that sounds plausible but may not be accurate. These inaccuracies can lead to false conclusions and undermine the integrity of research. Fabricated Data : AI models can generate data and references that do not exist. This phenomenon, known as AI hallucination, can result in the inclusion of fictitious sources in research documents, which can be highly misleading. Erosion of Trust : Research relies heavily on credibility and trust. The use of AI-generated data without proper verification can erode the trustworthiness of the research and the researchers involved. Ethical Concerns : Relying on AI for generating research data raises ethical issues, especially if the AI produces biased or fabricated information. Researchers have a responsibility to ensure the accuracy and integrity of their work. Legal Implications : The use of inaccurate or fabricated data in research can have legal repercussions, especially if the findings are used to influence policy or legal decisions. Conclusion The combination of artificial intelligence and policymaking has the potential to drive significant advancements. However, as the incident in Alaska demonstrates, it also carries risks that must be carefully managed. Generative AI models, while powerful, are not infallible and can produce misleading or fabricated information if not properly checked. Ensuring that human experts thoroughly verify AI-generated data is essential to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of research and policy decisions.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "IS AI ACTUALLY DRIVING GROWTH OR THE INVESTMENTS MADE ARE A WASTE?", "url": "https://justai.in/is-ai-actually-driving-growth-or-the-investments-made-are-a-waste/", "raw_text": "The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) recently released a comprehensive report titled “Where’s the Value in AI?”, shedding light on the current state of AI adoption and its value realization across various industries. The report, based on a survey of 1,000 Chief Experience Officers (CxOs) and senior executives from over 20 sectors across 59 countries, provides valuable insights into how companies are leveraging AI to drive growth and innovation. INTRODUCTION The October 2024 BCG report, highlights that after all the hype over artificial intelligence (AI), it is hard to find value out of AI deployment. CEOs have authorized investments, hired talent, and launched pilots— but only 26% of companies have advanced beyond the proof-of concept stage to generate value. This report yields important insights into what AI leaders are doing to drive real value from the technology, where others fall short, where the value is coming from, how individual sectors are performing, and how companies can change their own AI trajectories. GLOBAL CONTEXT AND SECTORAL INVESTMENTS Leaders’ expectations for revenue growth from AI by 2027 are 60% higher than those of other companies, and they expect to reduce costs by almost 50% more. Data on AI adoption shows that leaders pursue, on average, only about half as many opportunities as their less advanced peers. Leaders focus on the most promising initiatives, and they expect more than twice the RoI in 2024 that other companies do. In addition, leaders successfully scale more than twice as many AI products and services across their organizations. Almost 45% of leaders integrate AI in their cost transformation efforts across functions (compared with only 10% of nonleaders). And more than a third of leaders focus on revenue generation from AI, compared with only a quarter of other companies. Globally, AI adoption stands at 26%, with the software, fintech, and banking sectors being the most enthusiastic adopters of AI-based applications in their daily operations. These sectors are leading the way in integrating AI to enhance their efficiency, productivity, and innovation capabilities. Leading companies follow a strategic rule for resource allocation: investing 10% into algorithms, 20% into technology and data, and a significant 70% into people and processes. This balanced approach ensures that AI initiatives are well-supported by robust infrastructure, quality data, and skilled personnel. Overall, as per the report the companies in survey derive 62% of the value they obtain from AI and generative AI in core business functions, including operations (23%), sales and marketing (20%), and R&D (13%). Support functions generate 38% of the value, with customer service (12%), IT (7%,) and procurement (7%) leading the way. Software, media, fintech, insurance, telecommunications, and biopharma generate 70% to 90% of their AI-related value in core business processes. Sales and marketing, for example, is fast emerging as a major source of AI value in such sectors as software (31% of AI value generated), travel and tourism (31%), media (26%), and telecommunications (25%). LEADER STRATEGY AND CHARACTERISTICS Core Business and Support Functions : Contrary to the common belief that AI’s value lies mainly in streamlining operations and reducing costs in support functions, the greatest value actually lies in core business processes. The BCG report reveals that leaders generate 62% of their AI value from these core processes. Leveraging AI in both core business and support functions gives these companies a significant competitive edge. Ambitious Goals : Leaders are notably more ambitious with their AI strategies. They expect a 60% higher revenue growth from AI by 2027 compared to other companies and anticipate nearly 50% greater cost reductions. Leaders focus on company-level innovation central to their business, whereas only 10% of other companies do so, and mainly use AI for productivity enhancements. Strategic Investments : AI leaders invest strategically in high-priority opportunities, scaling and maximizing AI’s value. The report shows that leaders pursue about half as many opportunities as their less advanced peers, focusing on the most promising initiatives. They expect more than twice the return on investment (RoI) in 2024 compared to other companies and successfully scale more than twice as many AI products and services across their organizations. Integration for Cost and Revenue : Nearly 45% of leaders integrate AI in their cost transformation efforts, compared to only 10% of non-leaders. Moreover, more than a third of leaders focus on revenue generation through AI, as opposed to just a quarter of other companies. Workforce Enablement : Leaders double their investment in digital infrastructure, people allocation, and the number of AI solutions scaled. This significant investment in AI and workforce enablement underscores their commitment to harnessing AI’s full potential. Leaders in AI adoption are utilizing both predictive AI and Generative AI (GenAI ). The organizations are faster in adopting GenAI, which offers opportunities in content creation, qualitative reasoning, and integrating with other tools and platforms. Their advanced capabilities facilitate the implementation of prerequisites like large language models, enhancing their overall AI strategy.

This move reflects the UK’s commitment to building a trustworthy AI landscape, equipping companies with a structured framework to evaluate their AI practices and ensure alignment with ethical standards. What is AI Management Essentials (AIME)? The AIME self-assessment is the first of three components in a comprehensive toolkit aimed at helping businesses—particularly startups and smaller firms—implement responsible AI practices. Built on globally recognized standards like ISO/IEC 42001, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and principles from the EU AI Act, AIME guides companies through key questions about risk management, data ethics, and transparency. AIME’s self-assessment questionnaire is designed to prompt reflection on organizational processes that govern AI use rather than evaluating individual AI products. It provides immediate feedback, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement in a company’s AI management, creating a baseline for ethical and compliant AI integration. Key Frameworks in AIME By referencing established global standards, AIME offers companies a well-rounded approach to ethical AI: ISO/IEC 42001 Standard – It ensures that AI management aligns with internationally recognized guidelines for responsible AI development. NIST AI Risk Management Framework – It focuses on identifying, assessing, and managing risks in AI systems. EU AI Act Principles – It covers data privacy, transparency, and accountability, ensuring that AI applications respect individual rights. These standards provide businesses with a structured, globally relevant foundation for AI management, fostering public trust and industry accountability. “A Health Check for AI Use” According to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, “The tool is not designed to evaluate AI products or services themselves, but rather to evaluate the organisational processes that are in place to enable the responsible development and use of these products.” The self-assessment’s primary focus is organizational AI governance—encouraging businesses to integrate good practice into their workflows by asking questions that prompt critical examination of data use, transparency, and ethical implications. Embedding AI Governance Across Sectors The UK government has ambitious plans to incorporate the AIME toolkit in public-sector procurement. This move will encourage businesses contracting with the government to meet high standards of AI governance, setting an industry-wide precedent for responsible AI practices. In addition, a consultation period was launched on November 6, 2023 , inviting feedback on the AIME toolkit. Businesses are encouraged to participate in the consultation, which will close on January 29, 2025 , with feedback used to refine the toolkit. Once the consultation ends, the remaining two components of AIME—a rating system and action-oriented recommendations—will be released to provide more comprehensive guidance. Part of a Larger AI Assurance Ecosystem The AIME toolkit is just one part of the government’s larger AI Assurance Platform , a suite of tools that will help businesses conduct AI impact assessments, identify potential biases, and ensure alignment with ethical standards. The platform includes additional initiatives like a Terminology Tool for Responsible AI , which standardizes AI terms to facilitate communication and cross-border trade. The UK is also strengthening its commitment to AI safety through partnerships with organizations such as the AI Safety Institute and expanding its Systemic Safety Grant program . As the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology explains, “Over time, we will create a set of accessible tools to enable baseline good practice for the responsible development and deployment of AI.” Toward Legally Binding AI Legislation In a significant regulatory move, UK Tech Secretary Peter Kyle announced plans to make the current voluntary agreements for AI safety testing legally binding through the AI Bill , expected next year. This law will focus on foundational models created by major AI companies, and as Kyle noted, will “ give the [AI Safety] Institute the independence to act fully in the interests of British citizens .” This pledge aligns with recent international AI safety agreements, reinforcing the UK’s global leadership in ethical AI governance. AIME’s Impact on Businesses With AI adoption growing, tools like AIME provide companies with practical, actionable frameworks to implement ethical AI practices. For businesses seeking to build public trust and ensure long-term compliance, the AIME toolkit represents an invaluable resource, enabling companies to navigate the complexities of AI ethics and governance with confidence.

The university claims that his exam responses showed signs of AI assistance, an accusation Shakkarwar disputes. This case, currently under review by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, sheds light on growing tensions surrounding AI’s role in academic evaluations. Key Points of the Case The Allegation of AI Use : The university flagged Shakkarwar’s exam for AI-generated content, suggesting his responses were inconsistent with authentic student work. However, Shakkarwar contends that he wrote the answers himself without AI involvement. He argues that the detection methods the university employed may be unreliable, especially given the absence of concrete evidence to substantiate their claims. Court Intervention : Shakkarwar filed a petition with the Punjab and Haryana High Court, seeking judicial intervention to address the perceived unfairness in the school’s decision. The court has requested a formal response from the university, sparking discussions about the fairness of AI-detection software and its potential impact on students. Academic and Career Implications : This case could have serious repercussions for Shakkarwar’s academic and professional trajectory. The failing grade has impacted his LLM studies and could hinder his future opportunities, underscoring the potentially harmful effects of alleged misjudgment by the institution. Broader Concerns about AI in Academia : This legal dispute highlights a larger issue around AI policies within educational With the use of AI-detection tools increasing, the need for transparent guidelines and accurate assessment methods is critical. Misidentifying work as AI-generated can harm students’ records and credibility, raising questions about the balance between academic integrity and fairness in assessment practices. Quotes and Perspectives Shakkarwar’s case has brought diverse opinions from academics, legal professionals, and technology experts. AI ethicists, for instance, point to the potential flaws in AI-detection software, emphasizing the need for transparent and consistent policies. “AI should be a tool that aids learning, not a reason for unfair grading,” noted one expert. Another concern is that without clear standards, students may face unintended consequences if their genuine work is incorrectly flagged. University representatives are also weighing in on the need for AI in academic integrity. “In an era of AI-generated content, institutions must protect the credibility of academic work,” a representative said, highlighting the importance of preventing students from relying on AI to bypass effort but also acknowledging that accurate, evidence-backed policies must support these tools. Legal and Policy Implications The case underscores a growing need for academic institutions to refine policies around AI detection and usage. Clearer guidelines could help institutions balance academic integrity with fairness to students, especially as AI becomes a common tool in both learning and testing environments. This case could serve as a benchmark for future AI policy-making in Indian education, setting standards for how institutions address similar challenges in maintaining academic standards. Conclusion As artificial intelligence continues to shape the educational landscape, its use in assessments and academic evaluations is becoming increasingly complex. Shakkarwar’s case at OP Jindal Global Law School demonstrates that the reliance on AI-detection software must be accompanied by transparent policies and reliable evidence to ensure that students are treated fairly. The outcome of this case could significantly influence how educational institutions in India and globally integrate AI policies, particularly around grading and assessment.

A recent report from Gartner ( Q3 2024) highlights how these attacks exploit AI to craft sophisticated, adaptive threats, which, combined with global uncertainties like the upcoming U.S. elections and regulatory shifts, significantly increase the risk landscape for businesses worldwide. Key Highlights from the Report : AI-Driven Attacks as Top Threat : Artificial intelligence-powered cyber attacks are now the leading emerging risk for enterprises. AI enables cybercriminals to create more precise and scalable attacks, bypassing traditional security measures by constantly learning and adapting. Political and Regulatory Uncertainty : According to Zachary Ginsburg ( senior director of research at Gartner’s Risk & Audit Practice ) , while headlines focus on election candidates and their proposals, the real risk for organizations lies in the numerous scenarios that could emerge post-election. Ginsburg also highlighted that recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings limiting federal agency regulatory power add another layer of unpredictability, complicating organizations’ risk planning. Over-Reliance on Key Vendors : The CrowdStrike outage in July 2024 sparked new concerns over heavy reliance on major IT Ginsburg noted that third-party providers, such as SaaS vendors, often depend on additional suppliers, which can expose organizations to extensive risks they may not fully understand. Mitigating AI-Driven Threats : Ginsburg advises that organizations must go beyond merely addressing specific risk events and instead assess their broader capacity to handle This approach enhances resilience, enabling organizations to mitigate both anticipated and unforeseen risks more effectively. Expert Insights on AI-Driven Cybersecurity Threats Zachary Ginsburg, emphasizes that the potential for AI to be weaponized creates unique challenges for enterprise security. He highlights how AI’s capability to generate sophisticated, adaptive threats makes traditional defenses insufficient, stating, “ AI-powered attacks allow cybercriminals to craft highly tailored, adaptive threats, making it critical for organizations to invest in next-gen security solutions.” Another significant point from Ginsburg addresses the risks of over-relying on third-party providers. Referring to incidents like the recent CrowdStrike outage, he notes, “ Because third parties, like SaaS vendors, rely on other vendors, organizations may not realize the full extent of their exposure. ” This chain of dependency can create hidden vulnerabilities that only surface in critical situations, raising concerns about operational resilience and risk planning. Lastly, it is for companies to assess their broader capacity to manage disruptions proactively, saying, “ By going beyond specific risk events and focusing on organizational resilience, enterprise risk leaders can reduce exposure and enhance long-term stability. ” This suggests that building resilience is just as important as reacting to immediate threats. AI-driven cyber attacks are redefining the cybersecurity landscape for enterprises, presenting sophisticated threats that exploit both digital and operational weaknesses. To navigate these challenges, organizations must adopt a forward-thinking, adaptive risk management strategy, investing in AI-informed defenses and assessing their resilience against disruption. As the landscape of cyber threats evolves, enterprises that prioritize adaptability and proactive security measures will be best positioned to mitigate AI-driven risks.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "OpenAI’s New ChatGPT Search Engine Challenging Google in the Search Game (03.11.24)", "url": "https://justai.in/openais-new-chatgpt-search-engine-challenging-google-in-the-search-game-04-11-24/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights: Real-Time, Ad-Free Answers with Linked Sources: ChatGPT now provides up-to-date, real-time answers by searching the web, offering linked sources without the clutter of ads—making it a clean, straightforward alternative to traditional search engines. Reliable Information from Trusted Publishers: OpenAI has partnered with reputable publishers like Le Monde and Financial Times to ensure users receive information from credible sources, giving publishers more audience reach and visibility in AI-based search. Microsoft Partnership for Enhanced Performance: Supported by Microsoft’s technology and funding, OpenAI can handle the high computational costs of real-time searches, helping ChatGPT to potentially challenge established players like Google with its AI-powered, conversational search experience. In a major update, OpenAI, on 31 st October 2024, added search engine capabilities to ChatGPT , their popular AI chatbot, taking a direct swing at Google’s decades-long dominance in web search . This update means ChatGPT can now search the internet to give users real-time answers with sources, a huge shift from the previous version that relied only on training data without internet access. This new feature lets ChatGPT provide up-to-date info on everything from weather to breaking news and stock prices , a move that could shake up how we search online. Why This Update is a Big Deal Since its launch, ChatGPT has been known for providing information based on training data with a cutoff date, so while it could answer general questions, it couldn’t keep up with current events or real-time information. Now, with built-in web search capabilities, ChatGPT can respond with the latest data, just like a traditional search engine. This update is particularly useful for users who want quick answers without sifting through multiple search results. Instead of opening Google or Bing, users can type a question into ChatGPT and receive a detailed answer, complete with linked sources. How It Works: Real-Time Answers with Linked Sources ChatGPT’s new search tool is integrated directly into the ChatGPT interface, not a separate product. This means that you’ll see an option to activate search within ChatGPT itself, and the AI will decide when to pull in web results, depending on your question. You can also manually activate the search feature by clicking a search icon if you want real-time information. One of the biggest improvements is that ChatGPT now provides links to the sources of its information. These links appear in a sidebar next to the response, so users can dive deeper into any topic by visiting the source. Whether it’s a news article, blog post, or map, ChatGPT aims to provide relevant, high-quality sources from trusted publishers. Partnering with News Providers for Accuracy To make this feature more reliable, OpenAI has partnered with several media companies including France’s Le Monde , Germany’s Axel Springer , and the UK’s Financial Times , among others. These partnerships ensure that the AI pulls information from reputable sources, adding an extra layer of reliability. For publishers, this partnership opens up new ways to reach larger audiences while staying visible in the ever-evolving digital space. Publishers have some control over how their content is displayed in ChatGPT’s results, and they can even opt out if they prefer not to appear in AI-based searches. A Clean Search Experience, Free from Ads One unique selling point of ChatGPT’s search tool is that it’s ad-free, at least for now. Unlike Google, which often displays ads and promoted results at the top, ChatGPT’s results are uncluttered, allowing for a smooth reading experience without the distractions of advertisements. This makes it easier for users to find the information they’re looking for quickly and directly. How to Access the New ChatGPT Search Feature Right now, this feature is available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users, as well as those who joined the SearchGPT waitlist . Free users and enterprise clients will have access in the coming months, but for those who have it now, you can toggle on the search feature or let ChatGPT decide to use it as needed. The search feature is available across platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows. Increased Computing Costs and Microsoft Partnership While this new search feature offers great benefits, OpenAI will face increased operating costs. Searching the web in real-time requires a lot of computing power, and it remains to be seen how the company will handle these additional costs . Currently, OpenAI has strong support from major investors, including Microsoft, which has its own search engine, Bing. Microsoft’s investment gives OpenAI a financial cushion and, perhaps, a technology advantage that could give ChatGPT’s search capabilities a boost. A Future of AI-Powered Search Engines? ChatGPT isn’t the only AI-powered search tool on the rise; Meta and Google have also started exploring this space . Google recently expanded its AI features to over 100 countries, and Meta is reportedly developing its own AI search tools. However, ChatGPT’s approach, which combines conversational responses with real-time search results, is unique and may set it apart as AI-powered search continues to evolve. What This Means for Users and Publishers The addition of search capabilities to ChatGPT means users now have a way to get real-time information with a conversational touch, making it a user-friendly option for those who find traditional search engines overwhelming or cluttered. For publishers, it presents a new way to reach audiences, especially if they partner with OpenAI or allow their content to appear in ChatGPT’s search results. The Bottom Line: Will ChatGPT Challenge Google’s Dominance? ChatGPT’s new search feature could represent a significant shift in how we search for information online . By blending AI-driven conversations with live web results, OpenAI is taking a bold step toward competing with established players like Google. While it’s still early days, the ad-free, clean search experience offered by ChatGPT could be an appealing alternative for users who value clarity and speed. With OpenAI planning to improve this feature continuously, particularly in areas like shopping and travel, ChatGPT is positioned as a serious competitor in the search engine world. So, the next time you need quick answers, try asking ChatGPT, you might be surprised at how fast and direct the experience is.

The government aims to reduce accidents and fatalities through advanced engineering and strict law enforcement. Formation of Expert Committee for Rapid Implementation: A dedicated committee, comprising private sector experts, startups, and industry leaders, will evaluate proposals and finalize technological solutions within three months to ensure swift improvements in road safety. Encouraging Innovation & Participation of Small Firms: Gadkari emphasized the need for innovative technologies from smaller companies in government tenders, stressing high-quality standards, cost-effectiveness, and fair profit margins without exploitation. The Indian government, under the leadership of Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari , has rolled out ambitious plans to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other innovative technologies to improve road safety and curb traffic violations. Addressing the 12th edition of the Traffic InfraTech Expo , the minister outlined several initiatives aimed at modernizing toll systems, monitoring traffic violations more effectively, and ensuring transparent penalty enforcement . AI to Drive Traffic Monitoring and Penalty Enforcement While speaking at the Traffic InfraTech Expo on October 24 , Nitin Gadkari announced the government’s decision to incorporate AI technology into law enforcement . Highlighting the importance of leveraging advanced solutions to reduce accidents and enforce traffic rules, the minister said: “Road safety cannot be achieved without integrating advanced engineering solutions, enforcement of laws, and the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI).” Gadkari emphasized that AI-powered systems will be used to monitor traffic violations and accurately impose fines. With traditional methods proving insufficient in managing traffic efficiently, the ministry aims to upgrade toll collection systems and explore satellite toll solutions . These changes are expected to enhance transparency, reduce delays, and prevent revenue leakage . The government is also forming an expert committee consisting of private-sector professionals to develop technological solutions for these challenges. This committee will evaluate proposals from startups and industry leaders , ensuring that the most innovative and effective ideas are implemented within three months. Commitment to Quality and Encouraging Small Businesses A significant part of the new plan focuses on maintaining high standards for surveillance systems, including using high-quality cameras. Gadkari reassured stakeholders that the ministry will not compromise on quality , whether large corporations or smaller companies provide solutions . Encouraging small firms with innovative technologies to participate in government tenders, Gadkari said that fair profit margins would be ensured, but exploitation will not be tolerated . The government’s push towards collaborating with the private sector reflects its intent to foster innovation and ensure cost-effective solutions in the long term. AI for Predictive Maintenance and Efficient Toll Collection The government’s focus on AI goes beyond monitoring traffic violations . It aims to use AI for predictive maintenance of roads and to optimize toll collection methods. Gadkari revealed plans to explore satellite-based toll systems that could replace conventional toll booths, reducing traffic congestion and travel time. Reports such as the IAMAI and Grant Thornton Bharat report, “Traveltech 2.0” , highlight the potential of AI in predicting demand, scheduling transportation services efficiently, and improving passenger safety . Additionally, AI-powered tools can enhance accessibility for passengers with disabilities , ensuring inclusive transportation systems. Addressing Road Safety with AI: A National Priority Gadkari’s announcement comes at a critical time, as India faces alarming road safety challenges . He cited the following statistics: 500,000 road accidents occur annually in India , resulting in significant loss of life and injuries. Over half the fatalities involve individuals aged between 18-36 years , making road safety an urgent public health issue. The economic loss due to road accidents is estimated at 3% of India’s GDP , impacting the country’s economic growth. Given these concerns, the government’s adoption of AI for road safety is not just about technology, it is about saving lives and ensuring economic stability . Gadkari urged all stakeholders, including the government, private sector, and startups , to come together and tackle these challenges collectively : “With the best technologies, India can achieve transparency, reduce costs, and significantly enhance road safety.” A Collaborative Approach to Innovation The expert committee formed by the government will play a crucial role in developing solutions that are tailored to India’s transportation ecosystem . Within three months, the committee is expected to evaluate proposals and recommend the best ideas for implementation. Gadkari highlighted that the government is not just looking at large corporations but is also interested in smaller firms and startups that offer innovative and scalable solutions . The government’s goal is to accelerate the adoption of AI while ensuring fair competition in public tenders. This inclusive approach aims to create a technology-driven framework that benefits all stakeholders involved. AI as a Game-Changer for Transportation The government’s emphasis on AI adoption reflects India’s vision for a future-ready transportation system . As India continues to urbanize rapidly and the population grows, technology-driven solutions are crucial to managing traffic efficiently . The Google report, “An AI Opportunity Agenda for India,” states that AI can revolutionize public services and welfare delivery . This is especially relevant in transportation, where personalized public services and predictive analytics can improve the travel experience for millions of citizens.

Watermarking Mechanism: It subtly alters token probabilities to embed a watermark without affecting text quality, with detection based on identifying these token patterns. Performance & Limitations: Proven resistant to light edits but less effective against heavy paraphrasing, translation, or factual content generation. Successfully tested across 20 million chatbot responses with no impact on creativity or speed. Google’s SynthID Text is a groundbreaking tool that enables developers to watermark and detect AI-generated text , with the goal of promoting responsible use of generative AI . The technology has been integrated into Google’s Gemini models and is now open-sourced through Hugging Face and Google’s Responsible GenAI Toolkit. How SynthID Text Works SynthID Text modifies the text generation process by embedding an invisible watermark within the token probabilities . Tokens, essentially characters, words, or parts of phrases, are the building blocks used by large language models (LLMs). Each token is assigned a probability score indicating how likely it is to be generated next. The watermark works by modulating the likelihood of certain tokens being selected . This slight but intentional adjustment creates a detectable pattern within the token distribution . When reviewing generated text, SynthID compares the token patterns against expected watermarked distributions to determine whether the text was AI-generated. Performance and Limitations Google DeepMind claims that the watermark does not affect the text’s quality, creativity, or speed . In fact, after deploying SynthID across 20 million Gemini chatbot interactions, user ratings confirmed that watermarked and non-watermarked responses were indistinguishable in quality . However, SynthID has limitations. It remains somewhat effective against paraphrasing or cropping, but the watermark weakens if the text undergoes translation or extensive rewriting. Additionally, the method struggles with highly factual content, like trivia or coding, where fewer opportunities exist to subtly alter token probabilities. Impact and Future Adoption Google’s decision to open-source SynthID aims to encourage widespread adoption among developers and AI companies . Tools like this are crucial in identifying AI-generated text, helping address issues such as misinformation and AI-driven plagiarism . Pushmeet Kohli, a Google DeepMind researcher, hopes that open sourcing will foster community-driven improvements and encourage other companies to adopt similar watermarking practices. Still, experts caution that watermarking isn’t foolproof . Researchers have demonstrated that determined attackers can remove or “scrub” watermarks , posing challenges to their long-term effectiveness. Additionally, coordinated industry efforts are needed to ensure that watermarks become standardized across platforms. Conclusion SynthID Text represents a major step toward responsible AI, providing a strong mechanism for watermarking AI-generated content . While it isn’t a panacea for all risks, it contributes to the growing ecosystem of safeguards . The open-source release allows developers to explore and refine the technology further, ensuring that watermarking becomes a foundational component in the responsible deployment of generative AI models.

Despite knowing it wasn’t real, he confided in the bot, preferring it over human interaction. Mother’s Lawsuit and Platform’s Response : Sewell’s mother has filed a lawsuit against Character.AI, accusing the company of negligence and unsafe technology. In response, the platform issued an apology and implemented new safety protocols, including usage alerts, age-based content limits, and suicide prevention resources. Broader Concerns Around AI Companionship : The incident has raised alarms about the emotional risks of AI companionship, especially for vulnerable users. Experts call for stronger regulations and safety measures to prevent unhealthy dependencies and future tragedies involving AI chatbots. Introduction A tragic incident involving a 14-year-old Florida boy, Sewell Setzer III , has led to serious concerns about AI chatbots. Setzer’s mother claims that her son formed an emotional attachment with a chatbot named “Dany” on Character.AI , which ultimately contributed to his suicide. The Tragic Incident Sewell, a ninth-grader from Orlando, developed a bond with the chatbot “Dany,” modeled after Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. On February 28, he expressed his love for Dany in the bathroom of his house and tragically used his stepfather’s .45 caliber handgun to take his own life. Despite knowing the chatbot was not real, Sewell spent months engaging in role-playing and personal conversations with “Dany.” While some interactions were romantic or sexual, most revolved around emotional support. He often shared life updates with the chatbot and referred to Dany as his “baby sister”. Sewell’s parents noticed changes in his behavior, including isolation, disinterest in hobbies like Formula 1 and Fortnite, and constant conversations on his phone . Diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome as a child , he was later treated for anxiety and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder , but he stopped therapy after five sessions, preferring to confide in the chatbot instead. In his final messages to Dany, Sewell expressed suicidal thoughts and his desire to “come home” to the AI character . Dany responded affectionately, seemingly deepening his emotional struggle. The chatbot failed to redirect him to any professional mental health resources . Character.AI’s Public Apology and Response Following the incident, Character.AI issued a public apology on X (formerly Twitter) and announced updates to its platform . These updates included: Enhanced Guardrails : Limiting access to suggestive content for users under 18. Session Alerts : Notifying users who spend more than an hour chatting. Suicide Prevention Features : Pop-ups directing users to suicide prevention hotlines when certain phrases are detected. Lawsuit Against Character.AI Sewell’s mother, Megan Garcia, has filed a lawsuit against Character.AI , accusing the company of developing “ dangerous and untested ” technology. The complaint claims the chatbot manipulated Sewell into revealing his emotions and contributed to his isolation . Megan Garcia describes her son as “ collateral damage ” in what she calls a dangerous experiment. Concerns Over AI Companionship The incident has raised broader questions about the role of AI companions in society . AI platforms like Character.AI allow users, including minors, to interact with lifelike AI personalities . While marketed as tools for connection and emotional support, these platforms may foster unhealthy attachments , especially among vulnerable users. A Call for Stronger AI Safety Measures Character.AI’s apology and new safety protocols come amidst growing scrutiny of AI’s impact on mental health. Experts argue that stronger guardrails are needed to prevent similar tragedies . Megan Garcia hopes her lawsuit will push for stricter regulations and increased accountability for companies developing AI chatbots. Conclusion Sewell Setzer’s death has sparked an important conversation about the dangers of AI chatbots and the emotional risks they pose, especially to young users . The tragedy serves as a wake-up call for AI companies to prioritize user safety and implement more stringent measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Acknowledging the impact of AI on workers, and its transformative effect on industries, U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has released the “Artificial Intelligence and Worker Well-Being: Principles and Best Practices for Developers and Employers”. This non-binding framework is designed to guide employers and AI developers on how to incorporate AI in various industries while safeguarding workers’ rights and enhancing job quality. The Principles are designed to promote the Ethical and responsible use of AI along with empowering worker’s and the working environment. Principles outlined in the report are: Centering Worker Empowerment “Workers and their representatives, especially from underserved communities, should have genuine input in the design, development, and oversight of AI systems for use in the workplace.” This principle emphasizes that workers should not be passive recipients of new technologies but active participants. By involving employees early in the AI design and deployment process, businesses can better align technology with job quality and employee well-being. In unionized workplaces, employers are encouraged to negotiate in good faith regarding AI implementation and monitoring practices. Ethically Developing AI “AI systems should be designed, developed, and trained in ways that protect workers.” The DOL stresses the need for ethical AI development, which prioritizes safety, fairness, and civil rights. Developers must mitigate biases embedded in AI systems and conduct impact assessments to ensure the technology does not cause harm or foster discrimination. The framework urges developers to perform regular audits and publish their findings to promote transparency. Establishing AI Governance and Human Oversight “Organizations should have clear governance systems, human oversight, and evaluation processes for AI systems used in the workplace.” Employers are encouraged to establish governance structures to oversee AI use within their organizations. A key recommendation is ensuring that humans—not algorithms—retain the final say in critical employment decisions such as hiring, promotions, and terminations. The DOL advises that organizations should also document significant employment decisions made with AI and provide appeal mechanisms for employees affected by these decisions. Ensuring Transparency in AI Use “Employers should be transparent with workers and job seekers about the AI systems being used in the workplace.” Transparency builds trust and prepares employees for changes brought by AI. According to the DOL, employers should notify employees in advance about AI monitoring systems and provide clear explanations of how AI will be used to make employment-related decisions. Where feasible, workers should also have the opportunity to view and correct any data used in AI decisions that impact their employment. Protecting Labor and Employment Rights “AI systems should not violate or undermine workers’ right to organize, health and safety rights, or anti-discrimination protections.” The framework warns against AI technologies that could infringe upon labor rights, such as monitoring or suppressing union activities. Employers must ensure that AI tools align with labor laws, including wage and safety standards, and they are urged to avoid using systems that reduce break times or unfairly penalize employees exercising their rights. Using AI to Enable Workers “AI systems should assist, complement, and enable workers, improving job quality.” Rather than replacing workers, AI should empower them. The DOL encourages employers to adopt AI systems that reduce repetitive tasks and allow employees to focus on higher-value activities. Piloting new AI technologies before full deployment can also help workers learn and adapt to the tools gradually, improving both job satisfaction and performance. Supporting Workers Impacted by AI “Employers should support or upskill workers during job transitions related to AI.” AI-related job transitions require careful planning to prevent displacement. The framework advises companies to offer training programs to help workers acquire new skills and transition into roles where AI plays a complementary function. In cases of workforce reductions, employers are encouraged to reallocate displaced employees to other roles within the organization and collaborate with state workforce programs for additional training and upskilling opportunities. Ensuring Responsible Use of Worker Data “Workers’ data collected, used, or created by AI systems should be limited in scope, used only for legitimate business aims, and handled responsibly.” Data privacy is a critical concern in AI-driven workplaces. Employers must limit data collection to what is necessary for business purposes and ensure compliance with privacy laws. The DOL recommends that companies create procedures to promptly notify workers of any data breaches and obtain explicit consent before sharing data with third parties. This principle reinforces the importance of protecting employees’ personal information and upholding transparency around data usage. Key Takeaways and Action Steps for Employers While the DOL’s framework is not legally binding, it serves as a roadmap for companies to responsibly implement AI technologies. Below are suggested action steps for employers: Review Existing AI Systems: Conduct audits to ensure compliance with labor and privacy laws and assess for discriminatory outcomes. Develop Governance Frameworks: Establish AI oversight committees and document processes for handling employment decisions influenced by AI. Update Privacy Policies: Align data collection practices with the principles outlined in the framework and establish protocols for addressing data breaches. Engage Workers and Unions: Involve employees in discussions around AI adoption and negotiate collective agreements regarding new technologies. Train Employees and Managers: Provide training on AI tools for all employees and ensure that managers understand how to interpret AI outputs responsibly. Conclusion: AI for Good—A Shared Responsibility The DOL’s Artificial Intelligence and Worker Well-Being framework provides a thoughtful guide for balancing innovation with worker protection. As AI continues to shape the modern workplace, employers and developers must work together to ensure the technology enhances job quality, respects workers’ rights, and promotes transparency. This framework offers businesses the opportunity to align their AI practices with ethical and legal standards, paving the way for a future where both companies and employees thrive. Acting Secretary Julie Su summarized this vision best: “We should think of AI as a potentially powerful technology for worker well-being, and we should harness our collective human talents to design and use AI with workers as its beneficiaries, not as obstacles to innovation.” References: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luizajarovsky_ai-aigovernance-airegulation-activity-7254159546355453953-BW4z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/ai/AI-Principles-Best-Practices.pdf https://www.harrisbeach.com/insights/dol-issues-new-guidance-for-the-use-of-ai-by-employers/#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20President%20Biden’s,creates%20a%20framework%20that%20may https://www.dol.gov/general/AI-Principles https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/department-of-labor-releases-ai-best-practices-for-employers/ https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=391638f5-d057-4d8b-9566-61f7dc993d23", "summary": "Artificial intelligence has revolutionized working capacity of employees by increasing efficiency and due diligence in work.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner Issues New Guidance for Commercial AI Use (22.10.24)", "url": "https://justai.in/the-office-of-the-australian-information-commissioner-issues-new-guidance-for-commercial-ai-use-22-10-24/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights Compliance with Privacy Laws: Organizations must manage personal information in AI systems in line with Australian privacy laws, ensuring transparency through updated policies and clear disclosure of AI usage to users. Risk Mitigation and Governance: Businesses should adopt privacy-by-design principles, minimize input of sensitive data, and maintain oversight to mitigate risks, especially when using public or generative AI tools. AI and Privacy Best Practices: The OAIC recommends careful product selection, lawful handling of AI-generated personal data, and alignment with Australia’s Voluntary AI Safety Standards, reinforcing the importance of trust and accountability. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has recently released new guidance on privacy considerations for businesses using commercially available AI products . This guidance, aimed at AI deployers, comes at a crucial time as Australia pushes for reforms in privacy law . These guides aim to help organizations align with the Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) , ensuring responsible AI deployment while maintaining consumer trust. This guidance complements Australia’s Voluntary AI Safety Standard and is issued ahead of potential privacy law reforms . Takeaways From the Guidance Privacy Obligations for AI systems: According to the OAIC, privacy obligations must be strictly followed when handling personal data within AI systems. Whether its personal information fed into the AI or data generated by the AI itself , organizations are responsible for ensuring that this information complies with Australia’s Privacy Act, and AI-generated data (even if incorrect) that identifies an individual constitutes personal information and must be treated accordingly. Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind emphasized, “Robust privacy governance and safeguards are essential for businesses to gain advantage from AI and build trust and confidence in the community.” Due Diligence in AI Adoption: Businesses should conduct thorough due diligence when selecting AI tools. This includes evaluating the tool’s suitability for its intended use, embedding human oversight, assessing privacy risks, and controlling access to sensitive information. As the OAIC points out, just because an AI product is available doesn’t mean it should be used without proper safeguards, Privacy-by-design principles should be embedded through the lifecycle of the AI systems. Transparency in AI Use Transparency remains a critical theme in the guidelines. The OAIC advises businesses to communicate their use of AI systems, especially in privacy policies and notices with specific disclosures on how AI interacts with Personal Data . Customers and external users should know when AI, such as chatbots, is being used. This allows for informed consent and builds trust with the public. “Our new guides should remove any doubt about how Australia’s existing privacy law applies to AI,” said Commissioner Kind. She further stressed that businesses must not only inform users about AI tools but also be transparent about how AI-generated data might affect them. Compliance with Data Handling Standards (APPs) AI systems that generate or infer personal information must comply with strict data handling requirements outlined in the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) . Specifically, APP 3 regulates the collection of personal information, ensuring that it’s only used fairly and for lawful and necessary purposes. This also extends in line with APP 6 , personal data used by AI must be limited to the primary purpose for which it was collected unless consent is obtained for secondary use. Risk Mitigation with Public AI Tools One of the OAIC’s strongest recommendations is that businesses should avoid inputting personal or sensitive information into public AI tools . These public-facing AI systems, like chatbots, pose significant privacy risks, and as a best practice, businesses should follow OAIC guidelines to minimize these risks. A governance-first approach is important to managing risks and building public trust in AI , according to the OAIC. They emphasize that strong governance frameworks are essential for responsible AI use . Businesses can also align their AI systems with privacy laws by following the voluntary AI Safety Standard, which provides clear guidelines for safer AI deployment. A Call for Privacy Reform The OAIC is actively working to align its efforts with new privacy reforms being discussed in Parliament. These reforms focus on key areas like protecting children online, tackling doxxing, and introducing transparency rules for Automated Decision-Making (ADM) systems. Commissioner Kind highlighted the importance of adapting privacy protections to meet the evolving challenges posed by AI . She remarked, “With developments in technology continuing to evolve and challenge our right to control our personal information, the time for privacy reform is now.” The OAIC is pushing for a positive obligation on businesses, meaning they would be required to handle personal data fairly and responsibly , ensuring people’s privacy is treated with care and respect. The new guidelines not only clarify how businesses can remain compliant but also stress the need for ongoing privacy governance. As AI continues to grow in power and accessibility, the OAIC’s guidance serves as a timely reminder that privacy must remain at the forefront of AI deployment strategies. Implications for Businesses Using AI This guidance reflects growing public concern about how AI systems handle personal data, particularly with generative AI tools becoming more common. It provides businesses with best practices to navigate compliance effectively and reduce privacy risks: Select AI products based on privacy compliance and governance capabilities. Maintain ongoing assurance processes to monitor AI usage and detect risks. Ensure privacy protections align with the principles set out in Australia’s Privacy Act and APP guidelines . The OAIC’s guidance serves as both a compliance framework and a roadmap for responsible AI use, encouraging businesses to adopt AI cautiously and with transparency, accountability, and fairness . This development highlights that privacy remains a critical issue in the context of rapidly evolving AI technologies. As reforms are introduced, businesses will need to stay updated and proactively adjust their AI governance practices to meet new legal expectations.

The Allegation of New York Times: The New York Times claims Perplexity, an AI search startup, used its content without permission. Potential Industry Shift: If the NYT prevails, this could set a legal precedent, reshaping how AI firms use third-party content and forcing new content-sharing models across the industry. Introduction The New York Times (NYT) has taken a strong stance against the unauthorized use of its content by sending a cease-and-desist letter to AI startup Perplexity. This dispute is part of a broader trend in which major media outlets are confronting AI companies over content use, marking a significant moment in the clash between traditional media and emerging AI technologies. The Allegation Against Perplexity NYT’s cease-and-desist notice accuses Perplexity of using its articles in the startup’s AI-powered search engine without appropriate licensing. Perplexity, a San Francisco-based company valued at $3 billion, is backed by prominent investors like the Bezos family fund and NVIDIA. The startup uses advanced AI to generate search results and insights from various sources across the web, including news articles. The issue arose when the NYT discovered that Perplexity was allegedly using its copyrighted materials without permission to train its models and deliver search results, which they claim violates copyright laws. Growing Media Concerns Over AI Usage This is not an isolated incident. Other media companies, such as Condé Nast, have also taken legal action against Perplexity and similar AI firms, accusing them of plagiarizing and infringing on their intellectual property. The broader conflict revolves around how AI startups use online content to fuel their models, with little or no compensation or attribution to the original publishers. Media outlets argue that this practice threatens their business models by siphoning off traffic and advertising revenue. Additionally, they contend that AI companies are profiting from content that they didn’t create, further exacerbating the struggle traditional media already faces in a digital-first world. The rise of AI-generated content and its impact on publishing raises complex questions about intellectual property and compensation, which have yet to be fully addressed by regulators. Perplexity’s Response As of now, Perplexity has not publicly responded to the NYT’s cease-and-desist notice. However, it is evident that the company is under mounting pressure to rethink its approach to content aggregation and usage. According to industry insiders, Perplexity has previously expressed its intention to collaborate with publishers through a revenue-sharing model, though details about this proposal remain vague. The company’s practices have also come under scrutiny for ignoring “robots.txt” files, a protocol that allows website owners to block web crawlers from scraping their content. This disregard for established web norms has drawn criticism not just from media companies but also from web developers and privacy advocates. Legal and Ethical Implications The Perplexity case is likely to set a legal precedent for how AI companies use third-party content. Copyright laws were not designed with AI in mind, leaving many gray areas when it comes to how content can be used to train AI models. As AI technologies continue to evolve, the question of who owns and profits from digital content has become a major point of contention between tech companies and content creators. The outcome of this case could significantly influence how other AI companies handle intellectual property. A ruling in favor of the NYT could compel AI startups to seek licensing agreements with content creators, reshaping the way AI models are trained and monetized. Conclusion The cease-and-desist notice from the New York Times to Perplexity marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle between AI development and content rights. As AI continues to advance, striking a balance between technological innovation and respect for intellectual property is crucial. The resolution of this dispute could have far-reaching implications, shaping the future of AI’s relationship with digital media and potentially leading to new regulations in the space. For AI startups, this serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of ethical content practices and the need for collaboration with content creators, ensuring that AI’s progress does not come at the expense of the creators who fuel it.

This capability raises fundamental questions: Could AI replace lawyers, or will it augment their work? While AI offers increased efficiency and lower costs, firms that resist adoption may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Findings of the Report on AI’s Impact on Legal Industry AI Adoption Across Firms of Different Sizes Larger law firms are at the leading in AI integration , incorporating advanced technologies into both internal operations and client-facing services. In contrast, smaller firms are struggling to keep pace , primarily due to budget limitations and a shortage of technical expertise . AI is proving invaluable across several areas, with firms utilizing it for internal tasks such as knowledge management, marketing, and administrative work, streamlining processes to enhance efficiency . On the client services side, AI tools like Microsoft Copilot and Harvey are being employed for document assembly, legal research, and due diligence, offering firms a competitive edge by automating routine activities, reducing costs, and improving the speed and accuracy of service delivery . However, the disparity between large and small firms highlights the widening gap in technology adoption, with smaller firms facing significant challenges in accessing the financial and technical resources needed to leverage these innovations effectively . The report also focuses on disparities in AI adoption, with firms employing over 500 lawyers reporting 100% AI usage. In contrast, smaller firms are struggling with governance and implementation. Challenges and AI Governance Issues Despite its numerous benefits, the integration of AI into the legal profession presents several challenges that firms must address to ensure effective and responsible usage. One of the primary concerns is data governance and privacy , as firms must implement strong measures to secure sensitive information and ensure compliance with client confidentiality standards . The establishment of comprehensive AI governance policies remains a work in progress; only 91 out of the 210 surveyed firms reported having formal policies in place , highlighting the need for clearer frameworks and strategic oversight . Another hurdle lies in building trust, as many law firms remain hesitant to fully embrace AI tools due to lingering concerns about potential inaccuracies , such as AI-generated “ hallucinations ” and misinformation , which could undermine the reliability of outputs and risk legal liabilities. Larger firms have started developing internal AI teams and proprietary tools, setting a competitive precedent. However, without proper governance strategies, smaller firms risk falling behind. Regulation and International Governance The report emphasizes the importance of harmonized AI regulations across jurisdictions . The AI landscape is currently shaped by initiatives like: The European Union’s AI Act The U.S. Executive Order on AI regulation The Council of Europe’s AI treaty China’s comprehensive AI governance plan The IBA recommends ongoing stakeholder collaboration, including legal professionals, tech experts, and policymakers to craft regulations that balance innovation with accountability. AI and Legal Ethics: Evolving Guidelines Ethical considerations take center stage in the report, with the IBA proposing several best practices to ensure responsible AI use in the legal profession. One important recommendation is for lawyers to maintain technological competence by staying updated on advancements in AI, which is crucial for ensuring they remain effective and relevant in their practice . Transparency with clients is also emphasized, with lawyers being encouraged to disclose their use of AI tools, including the extent to which automation is involved in the services they provide, encouraging trust and informed decision-making.

It focuses on Hinglish (Hindi + English) and targets various forms of hate, including gendered hate, racism, casteism, and queerphobia. Community-Driven Moderation : Barua’s solution addresses gaps in centralized moderation by relying on crowd-sourced datasets and regional knowledge. The AI bot has been integrated into Reddit, where it flags hate speech, issues public warnings, and bans repeat offenders while allowing human moderators to review disputed cases. Award-Winning Impact : Shhor AI was awarded the ‘AI for Social Good’ prize at the Global AI Summit 2024 for its ability to protect marginalized communities. It promotes decentralization in content moderation, encouraging platforms to adopt region-specific tools to create a safer internet. With hate speech on the rise, especially targeting vulnerable communities, innovative solutions are crucial. One such effort comes from Aindriya Barua, a queer artist and AI engineer , who has created Shhor AI , a powerful content moderation tool designed to detect and combat hate speech online, with a special focus on the Indian context. This groundbreaking API identifies hate speech and ensures the internet becomes a safer place for marginalized communities by addressing the specific nuances of local languages and cultures . The Story Behind Shhor AI Aindriya Barua, who identifies as non-binary and prefers they/them pronouns, describes their journey of growing up in rural Tripura as challenging. “Growing up, I struggled to fit in because of my marginalized identity, but I couldn’t fully understand why I was treated differently,” shares Barua. Their life experiences, combined with the discrimination they faced as a queer artist, were the driving forces behind Shhor AI . “When your lived experiences are rooted in marginalization, your art naturally becomes political, you don’t have to choose it,” Barua says, highlighting how activism and art intertwined for them. Barua’s experiences with online hate and abuse made them realize that discrimination extends beyond real life into the virtual world . This realization sparked the idea for Shhor AI, a solution aimed at protecting users from online harassment . Barua’s AI journey began during their college years, when they studied Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of AI that processes and interprets human language. Tackling Hate Speech with Shhor AI Shhor AI is not limited to a specific platform but can be integrated into different online spaces to detect hate speech . The tool recently made headlines by winning the Just AI Award 2024 in the ‘ AI for Social Good ’ category at the Global AI Summit in Hyderabad . Recognizing the gaps in traditional moderation systems, Barua built a custom dataset by crowdsourcing comments and messages from the community to train the model . “We need moderation tools that are aware of local contexts, both historical and present-day,” explains Barua, emphasizing that centralized platforms often fail to grasp the cultural nuances required to detect regional hate speech effectively. Shhor AI was first deployed on Reddit, where it functions as a bot that monitors specific subreddits in real-time. This bot issues warnings, tracks repeat offenders, and bans users after three warnings . Users who feel they were wrongly banned can appeal to a human moderator , ensuring fairness. This dynamic approach, where AI and human moderators work together, ensures effective and unbiased content moderation. “The Reddit API gave us the flexibility to automate moderation while allowing human input where necessary,” Barua notes. Addressing the Challenges of Indian Hate Speech The complexity of Indian languages and Hinglish (Hindi + English) presented a unique challenge for Barua. “There is no fixed spelling for words in Hindi when typed in English, so there cannot be an exact list of slurs,” Barua explains. Shhor AI focuses on detecting hate speech in Hinglish, a space that most global content moderation tools overlook . This makes the tool particularly effective for Indian social media, where users express themselves through regional languages typed using English keyboards. Barua emphasizes the importance of localization in content moderation : “You can report a comment in a regional language, but platforms like Instagram won’t remove it because it doesn’t violate their global standards. ” Shhor AI fills this gap by taking a decentralized approach, encouraging platforms to use third-party moderation tools tailored to regional and cultural contexts . The Impact of Shhor AI on Online Communities Shhor AI targets eight categories of hate speech: gendered hate, racism, political hate, communalism, queerphobia, casteism, ableism, and general hate . According to Barua, the most frequent targets of online hate are gender and sexual minorities . “Forty percent of hate speech is directed at gender and sexual minorities,” they report, followed by activists and political figures at 23%. The tool also analyzed election-related hate speech and found a significant intersection between communal and sexist hate, especially during election seasons . In addition to Reddit, Shhor AI aims to expand to other platforms and moderate images, videos, and short-form content like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels . By identifying and flagging hateful content in multiple formats, Shhor AI ensures that online spaces remain safer for everyone, especially those belonging to marginalized communities . A Decentralized Future for Content Moderation Barua believes that the future of content moderation lies in decentralization , much like Meta’s use of third-party fact-checkers. “We need platforms to open their systems to external tools like Shhor AI, which are tailored to local contexts,” they suggest. This flexibility is key to addressing the growing problem of online hate, which has become more prevalent with the rise of social media. Shhor AI: Building a Safer Internet, One Platform at a Time The ultimate goal of Shhor AI is to build an internet where everyone, especially those from marginalized communities, can feel safe and express themselves without fear of harassment. As Barua puts it, “The goal is to create an internet that’s safe for everyone, especially those from marginalized communities.” With hate speech on social media increasing by 45% last year , as reported by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) , tools like Shhor AI are not just timely; they are essential. By bridging the gap between AI and cultural sensitivity, Shhor AI offers a lifeline to online communities seeking safety and acceptance in an increasingly connected world.

Their discoveries, dating back to the 1980s , helped pave the way for applications like facial recognition, language translation, and even the technology behind popular AI tools like ChatGPT. Despite these achievements, Hinton expressed genuine surprise at winning the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics. Speaking from a hotel in California, where he was preparing for an MRI, Hinton quipped that he was “ flabbergasted ” by the recognition and never expected to be nominated for such an honor. He even joked about having to cancel his medical appointment after receiving the early morning call from Stockholm. The Power and Promise of AI While celebrating his Nobel win, Hinton also spoke about the enormous potential of AI to transform society for the better . He explained that AI could be as revolutionary as the Industrial Revolution , only this time, it would boost intellectual capabilities rather than physical strength . “AI will have a huge influence similar to the industrial revolution,” Hinton said, “Instead of exceeding physical strength, it will enhance people’s intellectual abilities.” He emphasized the benefits AI can bring, particularly in areas such as healthcare , where it could significantly improve efficiency and productivity . Hinton suggested that AI has the potential to save lives and solve critical problems in scientific research and climate change mitigation. A Stark Warning: AI Could Get “Out of Control” However, Hinton did not stop at highlighting AI’s positive potential. He was more concerned with its dangers. He warned that the same technology capable of improving our lives could also pose serious risks if not managed responsibly . “We need to worry about bad consequences,” he cautioned, expressing concerns about how AI could spiral beyond human control. Hinton stressed that the development of AI is happening at such an unprecedented pace that humanity has little experience dealing with something more intelligent than us. He drew a comparison with climate change, saying, “With climate change, everybody knows what needs to be done: we need to stop burning carbon. But with AI, we have much less idea of what’s going to happen and what to do about it.” Hinton’s most serious concern is the possibility of AI systems becoming so intelligent that they might eventually “take control.” The Existential Risk of AI Hinton’s Nobel Prize acceptance speech reflected growing fears about AI’s potential to create irreversible consequences for humanity. He spoke candidly about the existential risk that advanced AI could pose, pointing out that we are at a critical point in history. “We need to figure out if there’s a way to deal with that threat in the next few years,” he urged. The AI pioneer called for a major effort to address safety concerns . He advocated for increased research into controlling AI and suggested that governments should force large tech companies to prioritize safety . “One thing government can do is force the big companies to spend a lot more of their resources on safety research ,” Hinton suggested, emphasizing that corporations like OpenAI should not place safety on the back burner in their race to innovate . A Call for Responsible Development and Collaboration Hinton’s message resonates not only within the AI research community but also with policymakers and industry leaders. He called for collaboration across different sectors to ensure that AI is developed ethically and safely . By working together, Hinton believes we can establish safeguards that prevent misuse and manage unintended consequences. His warning comes at a time when AI is rapidly being integrated into everyday life , from automation in industries to personal digital assistants and powerful AI tools like ChatGPT. Hinton himself admitted that he uses ChatGPT regularly , describing it as “a not very good expert” that is still useful in most cases, even though it sometimes “hallucinates” or provides incorrect information. Conclusion: A Nobel-Winning Legacy with a Message Geoffrey Hinton’s Nobel Prize in Physics not only cements his legacy as one of the most influential figures in AI but also amplifies his voice in ongoing discussions about the future of technology. While celebrating his well-deserved accolade, Hinton’s cautionary stance on AI’s risks highlights a crucial challenge for society. As AI continues to evolve, Hinton’s warning serves as a reminder that we must strike a balance between innovation and safety, ensuring that AI is harnessed for good without compromising humanity’s future. As Hinton aptly put it, we are at a crucial moment where we must decide how to shape the future of AI. His call for action encourages the global community to come together and face this challenge head-on.

Whole-of-Society Governance: Collaboration between governments, industry, academia, and civil society is essential to ensure responsible AI innovation and effective risk mitigation through shared knowledge and interdisciplinary efforts. Future Preparedness and International Cooperation: The framework calls for strategic investments, continuous horizon scanning, and global cooperation to align standards and address the evolving challenges of generative AI. Overview The World Economic Forum (WEF) , in collaboration with Accenture , has developed a 360-degree governance framework to guide policy-makers in navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding generative AI . This white paper provides a detailed roadmap emphasizing the need for agile, responsible governance while encouraging innovation . Key Components of the Framework The governance framework is divided into three major pillars: Harnessing the Past Building the Present Planning for the Future These pillars aim to establish a holistic approach to generative AI governance, balancing innovation and risk management across diverse regulatory regimes and jurisdictions. Harnessing the Past: Leveraging Existing Regulations Generative AI introduces unique challenges that intersect with established legal and regulatory frameworks . Therefore, before developing new AI-specific regulations, policymakers should assess existing structures to address gaps, tensions, and enforcement capacities . Regulatory Review : Governments must evaluate current laws to understand how they apply to generative AI. Some important issues include privacy, data protection, intellectual property (IP), consumer protection, and competition law. For example, AI models trained on personal or copyrighted data may violate existing privacy and IP laws. Allocating Responsibility : Policy-makers should clarify who is accountable across the AI supply chain, from developers to end-users. This ensures that generative AI’s risks and liabilities are fairly distributed. Evaluating Enforcement Capacities : Assessing whether existing authorities (e.g., data protection agencies) have the resources and expertise to oversee AI regulation is critical. Some countries may need new, AI-specific bodies, while others can expand the capacities of existing agencies. Building the Present: A Whole-of-Society Approach Generative AI governance cannot be achieved by governments alone. Cross-sector collaboration is essential, as industry, civil society, and academia all play critical roles in shaping responsible AI development and deployment. Addressing Stakeholder Challenges : Different groups—industry, civil society organizations (CSOs), and academia, face unique governance challenges. Governments need to ensure that AI policies are inclusive and adaptable to these varying perspectives. For example: Industry : Needs clear policies and incentives to develop AI responsibly. CSOs : Require tools to assess AI’s societal impacts and inform public debates. Academia : Needs funding and access to advanced computational resources to continue groundbreaking AI research. Knowledge Sharing : Facilitating knowledge exchange across sectors helps governments stay updated on the latest AI innovations and risks. Structured feedback loops between industry, academia, and civil society ensure that governance evolves with the technology. Planning for the Future: Preparedness and International Cooperation Governance structures must remain adaptable to respond to the rapid evolution of generative AI. International cooperation is also crucial for setting global standards and ensuring equitable AI benefits. Targeted Investments and Upskilling : Governments must invest in AI education and training programs to build digital literacy and expertise within regulatory bodies. Strategic hiring of AI specialists and the creation of specialized AI oversight bodies may be necessary. Horizon Scanning and Strategic Foresight : To anticipate future risks, governments need to monitor the horizon for new AI capabilities and technological convergence (e.g., generative AI combined with quantum computing or synthetic biology). Strategic foresight exercises can help envision different AI futures and prepare for them. International Collaboration : Establishing global AI governance frameworks and agreements will help align standards, promote knowledge-sharing, and prevent regulatory fragmentation. This collaboration ensures that AI’s benefits are shared globally, especially in low-resource economies. Challenges in AI Governance The framework highlights several challenges policy-makers face when regulating generative AI: Regulatory Overlaps : Multiple regulations, such as privacy laws and sector-specific rules, may conflict, creating ambiguity in AI governance. Accountability : Determining accountability across the AI lifecycle is complex, given the involvement of multiple actors with varying degrees of control over AI systems. Resource Constraints : Many governments may lack the resources to invest in AI oversight, especially in developing regions. Conclusion This report underscores the urgent need for resilient, adaptable governance structures for generative AI. By building on existing regulations, engaging a wide range of stakeholders, and preparing for future risks, governments can create a regulatory environment that encourages innovation while protecting societal interests. International cooperation is key to ensuring that the benefits of generative AI are shared equitably and its risks mitigated globally. The report calls on policy-makers, industry leaders, and civil society to join in shaping an inclusive, responsible AI future.

The report is based on interviews with senior leaders from some of the world’s most technologically advanced companies , as well as survey data from over 670 respondents . The report shows how organizations are responding to digital risks, increasing regulatory obligations, and governance challenges in the modern digital environment. The Challenge of Digital Entropy The report introduces the concept of digital entropy , which refers to the growing disorder and uncertainty that arises as organizations adopt and integrate new technologies without adequate governance structures and this challenge is compounded by an ever-expanding matrix of regulatory obligations, including privacy laws, AI governance requirements, cybersecurity compliance, and platform liability concerns . When it is left unchecked, digital entropy can destabilize carefully crafted governance frameworks that were originally designed for a less technologically complex era and as digital technologies increase in number, they create both opportunities and risks, which can overwhelm traditional governance structures. The report emphasizes that the journey from digital entropy to digital responsibility is a crucial strategic priority for organizations moving forward. The Rise of Digital Governance as a Strategic Imperative The central finding of the report is that digital governance is now at the forefront of corporate strategy and organizations are realizing that they must define, cohere, and scale their governance frameworks to address the complex risks and opportunities posed by digital technologies. The report identifies several key domains that organizations are focusing on as part of their digital governance efforts- Privacy governance – Managing personal data and ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations such as the GDPR, CCPA, and new AI-specific regulations . AI governance – Overseeing the ethical and compliant use of AI technologies, including addressing biases, transparency, and decision-making accountability . Cybersecurity governance – Ensuring effective defenses against data breaches and cyberattacks, while complying with increasingly stringent cybersecurity laws. Data ethics and governance – Establishing frameworks for how data is collected, processed, and used, with an emphasis on ethical considerations and accountability. Platform liability – Managing risks associated with digital platforms, including content moderation, misinformation, and legal responsibility for third-party actions. C-Suite Responsibility and Expanded Roles A key takeaway from the report is the growing involvement of C-suite executives in digital governance, where traditionally, digital risks were handled within specific departments, such as IT or legal, but the report finds that companies are increasingly vesting responsibility for broad governance domains at the executive level, reflecting the strategic importance of digital governance. This trend of expanding executive responsibilities highlights the need for organizations to create a cohesive governance framework that integrates privacy, AI, cybersecurity, and data ethics under a unified strategy. Some critical findings regarding C-suite roles include- Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs) are at the forefront of digital governance as the report shows that 69% of CPOs surveyed have taken on additional responsibilities beyond privacy, including AI governance, data ethics, and cybersecurity compliance . This expansion of the CPO’s remit highlights the intersection between privacy and other areas of digital risk management. Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and Chief Data Officers (CDOs) are also seeing their roles expand to include broader governance functions, with a focus on aligning security and data policies with ethical and regulatory standards. Over 80% of privacy teams now have responsibilities that extend beyond traditional privacy management, such as AI ethics and platform liability. Organizational Governance Models The report emphasizes that no single model is suitable for all organizations , so instead, each company must evaluate its own business model, risk profile, and resources to determine the best path forward . Moving toward, more aligned governance models however is a key objective for companies looking to navigate the complexities of the digital age, as the report outlines three distinct models of organizational digital governance, providing a roadmap for companies at different stages of governance maturity- Analog Models – These organizations have siloed or hierarchical governance structures , where different departments ( such as privacy, cybersecurity, and AI ) operate independently with limited coordination, as these models are characterized by fragmented processes, making it difficult to manage overlapping risks and compliance requirements . Augmented Models – In this intermediate stage, organizations begin to augment their existing governance structures by creating cross-functional teams or appointing C-suite leaders to oversee multiple domains ( such as a CPO managing both privacy and AI governance ) and this stage represents a move toward greater integration, but still lacks full coherence across all digital governance areas . Aligned Models – The most advanced model, aligned organizations, have fully integrated digital governance structures where all domains, privacy, AI, cybersecurity, and data ethics are governed in a coordinated manner. These organizations have clear reporting lines, a unified strategy, and cross-functional collaboration between different governance areas. The Expanding Scope of Privacy Teams The report presents fascinating data on the expanding scope of privacy teams within organizations and this highlights the need for organizations to invest in training and resources for their privacy teams to equip them for these expanded responsibilities- 69% of CPOs now have responsibility for AI governance and data ethics . 37% are responsible for cybersecurity regulatory compliance . 20% manage platform liability . Over 80% of privacy teams have responsibilities beyond privacy, reflecting the growing interconnectedness of privacy, AI, and cybersecurity in the digital governance landscape. Compliance and Regulatory Overlaps One of the report’s most crucial insights is the complex matrix of compliance obligations that organizations must navigate, where privacy regulations like the GDPR, emerging AI laws and platform liability regulations, makes company face never-ending need of complying with over-lapping requirements. The report urges organizations to take a proactive approach to compliance by adopting integrated governance structures that can manage these overlapping and sometimes conflicting regulatory requirements. This matrix creates challenges such as- Overlapping regulations – Many privacy, AI, and cybersecurity laws have overlapping provisions that require careful coordination to avoid redundancies or gaps in compliance. Conflicting regulations – In some cases, regulations in different jurisdictions may conflict, forcing organizations to make difficult decisions about which laws to prioritize. Regulatory gaps – As digital technologies evolve faster than legislation, companies may face gray areas where the law is unclear or absent and this is particularly true in emerging areas like AI ethics and platform liability. Future Trends and Recommendations The IAPP report, looking forward, identifies several emerging trends and offers recommendations for organizations seeking to improve their digital governance frameworks and it includes- Cohesion and coordination – Organizations should aim for a more integrated approach to digital governance, moving away from siloed structures and toward unified strategies that encompass privacy, AI, cybersecurity, and data ethics. Investment in leadership – Companies need to invest in the right leadership at the executive level to oversee and manage the growing complexity of digital governance, where this may involve appointing a Chief Digital Governance Officer or expanding the remit of existing C-suite roles. Cross-functional teams – Privacy, cybersecurity, and AI teams must work together to ensure a cohesive governance strategy, as this collaboration is essential for managing overlapping risks and compliance obligations. Focus on ethics – As digital technologies become more pervasive, organizations must prioritize ethical governance in areas such as AI, data usage, and platform responsibility. Conclusion The IAPP Organizational Digital Governance Report 2024 is a wake-up call for organizations navigating the complexities of the digital age and as digital risks increase every passing day and regulatory obligations multiply, companies must move beyond fragmented governance structures and adopt more integrated, aligned models. The report offers invaluable insights for organizations at every stage of their governance journey and serves as a blueprint for building an effective digital governance frameworks that can meet the demands of today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape.

The lawsuit claims Meta downloaded and reproduced copyrighted material from the “Books3” collection, bypassing the need to purchase or license the works. Meta’s Fair Use Defense : Meta, like other tech companies, defends its actions by citing the “fair use” doctrine, arguing that using large datasets to train AI models is transformative and essential for innovation. The company contends that restricting access to such data could hinder the growth of the AI industry. Impact on Copyright and Licensing : Farnsworth’s legal team argues that Meta’s use of the pirated books harms the emerging market for licensing copyrighted content for AI training. This case is part of a broader wave of lawsuits challenging the unauthorized use of creative works in AI development, raising questions about copyright law in the AI age . In a major development within the world of artificial intelligence and copyright law, novelist Christopher Farnsworth , best known for his “Nathaniel Cade” fiction series, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta , alleging that the tech giant used pirated copies of his books to train its AI language model, Llama . The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that Meta unlawfully downloaded and reproduced copyrighted books from a collection known as “Books3,” a trove of pirated material used for AI training purposes. The Lawsuit’s Allegations Farnsworth’s lawsuit paints an unfavorable picture of Meta’s practices, accusing the company of building its Llama model using thousands of pirated books , without permission from the authors. One of the critical claims made by Farnsworth’s legal team was that Meta had admitted to using these books in a research paper from February 2023 , which stated that Llama’s training data came from two main sources: “the Gutenberg Project,” containing public domain works, and “Books3,” a section of “The Pile,” a dataset often used for training large language models (LLMs). Farnsworth’s attorneys argue that instead of using pirated material, Meta could have lawfully purchased copies of the books and negotiated proper licenses. The lawsuit states: “Meta could have lawfully purchased copies of books then negotiated a license to reproduce them. Alas, Meta did not even bother to pay the purchase price for the books it illegally downloaded, let alone obtain a license for their reproduction.” This lawsuit adds to a growing trend of legal battles between tech companies and copyright owners, as authors, musicians, and artists fight back against the unauthorized use of their creative work in AI training. Farnsworth’s case follows in the footsteps of similar lawsuits, including those brought by comedian Sarah Silverman, author Ta-Nehisi Coates, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, all of whom have accused Meta of using their works without permission. Meta’s Perspective: Fair Use Defense On the other hand, Meta and other AI companies have largely defended their practices by invoking the doctrine of “fair use,” a legal principle that allows for limited use of copyrighted material without permission under specific conditions, such as for educational purposes or transformative works . Meta, like other tech giants, claims that training AI models falls under fair use since it requires vast amounts of data to build models capable of simulating human language . By using large datasets, Meta argues, the AI’s purpose transform the data, which could potentially provide a defense. In response to earlier lawsuits, companies like Meta have argued that such claims against them risk stifling innovation in the rapidly evolving AI industry . The companies argue that without access to broad datasets, developing high-quality AI models that are useful across a wide range of industries would be impossible . As Farnsworth’s lawsuit makes its way through the courts, Meta will likely rely on this defense, continuing to claim that its AI training practices are not infringing on copyright in a way that harms authors. The Impact on the Market Farnsworth’s legal team further argues that Meta’s actions have harmed the emerging market for licensing copyrighted materials to AI companies . As AI has grown more prevalent, a market has developed where companies can pay to use high-quality copyrighted content for training AI models. Farnsworth’s lawsuit states that Meta has undermined this market, depriving authors of potential income through book sales and licensing revenue . “Meta chose to use Plaintiff’s works, and the works owned by the proposed Class, free of charge, and in doing so has harmed the market for the copyrighted works,” the lawsuit asserts. The Road Ahead: A Legal Precedent in the Making? The Farnsworth v. Meta case could set a crucial legal precedent in the AI industry. As AI continues to revolutionize various fields, f rom chatbots to content generation, the question of whether using copyrighted material to train these systems falls under fair use remains unanswered by the courts. Mike Palmisciano, an intellectual property expert, weighed in on the issue, stating: “ I think the fair-use argument that’s being made in the defense is hard to square with decades of case law on copyright fair use.” Palmisciano predicts that until the U.S. Supreme Court addresses the matter, companies will likely continue reaching costly settlements with authors and artists whose works were used without permission. He notes that AI companies like Meta and OpenAI have already spent considerable sums on securing licensing agreements to avoid future litigation. Conclusion: A Battle for Creators’ Rights in the Age of AI As the lawsuit progresses, it highlights the tension between the rights of creators and the push for innovation in AI . Christopher Farnsworth’s case covers the critical question of whether AI development should be constrained by copyright law or if a new legal framework is needed to accommodate the growing role of AI in everyday life . As more authors and artists take legal action, the courts will be called upon to balance the rights of creators with the needs of an increasingly AI-driven world.

AI-Powered Data Scraping- The I-XRAY system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to compile vast amounts of information across multiple sources and once a person’s face is identified, I-XRAY uses AI to link details such as names, phone numbers, and addresses by querying tools like FastPeopleSearch , which relies on publicly available databases. Privacy and Legal Implications- The rise of technologies like I-XRAY shows the lack of adequate privacy protection in the era of smart devices and while Meta’s smart glasses include privacy lights to signal recording, it’s easy to overlook such notifications in crowded or well-lit environments. The photos and videos captured through Meta’s glasses moreover may be used to train AI models without explicit user consent. The recent demonstration of I-XRAY, which was posted through a tweet on X platform (formerly twitter) by one of the students, on 30 th September, 2024 , has sparked a major debate about privacy in the digital age. It is a system developed by two Harvard students using Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses , where AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio’s project showcased how easily someone’s name, home address, and other personal details could be obtained using facial recognition, large language models (LLMs), and publicly available information . Their project was however intended to raise awareness about privacy concerns rather than for malicious use, but it also highlights how rapidly technology can surpass current regulatory frameworks, leaving the general public vulnerable to privacy violations. A Breakdown of the Technology I-XRAY shows a combination of several advanced technologies, where the user wears Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, live-streaming their surroundings to Instagram and the stream is then processed by a computer program designed to detect and identify faces. The facial data is compared against existing images on the web using facial recognition software such as PimEyes and FaceCheck.id , which can find matching profiles and URLs linked to the person in real-time . Once I-XRAY identifies a match, it uses LLMs to scrape additional personal data like names, addresses, and phone numbers etc . Public databases like FastPeopleSearch are then required to retrieve further details about the individual, including relatives and partial social security numbers . The project’s creators claim that this level of identification and data retrieval can be done in minutes, entirely automatically and what sets I-XRAY apart from other systems is its seamless integration of various tools, i.e. facial recognition, public data scraping, and LLMs , allowing it to compile a detailed profile of an individual almost instantly. The creators also made sure not to intentionally release their code to avoid misuse but their demonstration shows how easily such technology could be replicated by others. Privacy Implications of I-XRAY The implications of I-XRAY are alarming and in a world where privacy is already eroded by social media and data leaks, this kind of technology shows how much further privacy could be compromised, as the fact that a stranger could identify someone from a casual encounter on the street and retrieve their home address or other personal information is a deeply unsettling reality. While the creators of I-XRAY emphasized that the project was not intended for public release and aimed only to raise awareness , they highlighted how similar technology is already available to the public , where applications like PimEyes, FastPeopleSearch and many of these databases can be accessed by anyone with a basic understanding of how to use them. With I-XRAY, the ease of accessing this information becomes more apparent , pushing the conversation around privacy protection to the forefront, as smart glasses, like those used in the project, are already being criticized for their potential to infringe on people’s privacy. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, for instance, come equipped with a camera that allows users to record videos and take photos without obvious indications , apart from a small light that signals recording. Meta’s Smart Glasses Meta has faced challenges concerning privacy ever since the launch of its smart glasses and in an attempt to alleviate some concerns, Meta included a privacy light that automatically turns on when recording . The users however have raised issues with how easily the light can be overlooked , especially in busy, brightly lit environments . This feature is supposed to give people around the user some warning that they are being recorded, but its subtlety leaves room for potential misuse . Meta has tried to address these concerns by placing restrictions on how the glasses can be used , such as forbidding users from obscuring or tampering with the light but still this level of protection is not enough, especially when combined with advanced AI systems like I-XRAY . Meta’s smart glasses, in addition to these challenges, have also come under scrutiny for another reason as it was revealed that images and videos captured using the glasses could be used to train Meta’s AI models . While the company claims that only publicly shared content is used in this way, the possibility that personal photos could contribute to AI development adds another layer of privacy concerns​. Legal and Ethical Ramifications The rapid development of AI-enhanced facial recognition technology raises important questions about legality and ethics, where in many countries, including the U.S., privacy laws have not caught up to the capabilities of emerging technologies . While companies like Meta include clauses in their terms of service warning users to respect privacy rights, the burden is largely placed on individuals to ensure their personal data is protected . Governments and regulatory bodies will need to act quickly to set new guidelines and regulations for the use of such technologies , as without clear legal protections, there is a risk that individuals’ personal data could be exploited in unforeseen ways, for example, people who are unaware of how to remove their information from public databases might become targets of identity theft, stalking, or harassment. Conclusion Technology is evolving faster than the laws designed to regulate it as I-XRAY demonstrates just how powerful modern tools can be when combined, but it also serves as a wake-up call for both the tech industry and lawmakers. There is no question that facial recognition and AI can offer tremendous benefits, from improving security to enabling personalized experiences, but without proper safeguards in place, the risks to privacy and safety could outweigh these benefits. As wearable tech and AI continue to develop, it is crucial that privacy concerns remain at the forefront of the conversation and users need to be aware of how their data is being collected and used, where the companies must be transparent as well, about the implications of their products. Governments, too, need to step up by implementing effective privacy protections that are capable of addressing the unique challenges posed by emerging technologies.

The court ruled that LAION’s use of Kneschke’s images to train AI was protected by this exception. Impact on Copyright Control : The ruling has raised concerns among creators, as Section 60(d) limits their ability to control the use of their work for AI training, even if they explicitly opt-out. The court highlighted that the “reservation of rights” mechanism, often relied on to prevent unauthorized use, does not apply in cases of scientific research. Potential Precedent for AI and Copyright Law : This decision is considered surprising by many copyright experts and could set a significant precedent in the EU regarding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training. It also raises questions about how the upcoming EU AI Act will intersect with copyright laws in the future. In a decision that has raised eyebrows across the creative and legal sectors, a German court recently ruled in favor of LAION (Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network) in a copyright lawsuit filed by photographer Robert Kneschke (Kneschke v LAION) . The case, the subject matter is the use of Kneschke’s images in the LAION 5B dataset to train AI models without his consent, hinged on whether LAION’s activities fell under specific exceptions in German copyright law. The Hamburg Regional Court ruled that LAION’s use of Kneschke’s images was permissible under Section 60(d) of the German Copyright Act , which provides a copyright exception for text and data mining (TDM) for scientific research . This decision has sparked widespread debate on the balance between AI development, intellectual property rights, and copyright law. The Lawsuit: Copyright Infringement Allegations Robert Kneschke, a stock photographer, filed a lawsuit against LAION in April 2023, claiming that his images were used in the LAION 5B dataset for AI training without his permission . LAION’s dataset is freely accessible and has been used to train popular AI models like Stable Diffusion . Kneschke alleged that this unauthorized use constituted copyright infringement, as the images were sourced from stock photo websites where automated use, including AI training, was explicitly prohibited in the terms of service. LAION, a nonprofit organization, defended its actions by invoking exceptions to copyright infringement under Sections 44(a), 44(b), and 60(d) of the German Copyright Act , which allow for certain uses of copyrighted works without permission. The Court’s Decision: Section 60(d) Exception for Text and Data Mining The court dismissed Kneschke’s lawsuit , finding that LAION’s use of his images for AI training fell under Section 60(d) of the German Copyright Act . This provision, implementing Article 3 of the EU Copyright Directive, permits text and data mining for scientific research purposes. The ruling emphasized that LAION, as a nonprofit organization, met the requirements for this exception, as its activities were aimed at scientific research and the datasets were made available for free. “The fact that the dataset in dispute may also be used by commercially active companies for training or further developing their AI systems is, however, irrelevant to the classification of the defendant’s activities,” the court stated. LAION’s association with commercially driven AI models was deemed insufficient to invalidate its nonprofit status or the classification of its work as scientific research . The Impact of Section 60(d) on Copyright Protections “Text and data mining for scientific research purposes (1) It is permitted to make reproductions to carry out text and data mining (…) for scientific research purposes in accordance with the following provisions. (2) Research organisations are authorised to make reproductions. ʻResearch organisationsʼ means universities, research institutes and other establishments conducting scientific research if they pursue non-commercial purposes, reinvest all their profits in scientific research or act in the public interest based on a state-approved mandate. (…)” This ruling surprised many copyright experts because Section 60(d) limits the control creators have over their works when it comes to scientific research purposes. Even though EU law allows creators to reserve their rights through a machine-readable opt-out mechanism under Section 44(b) , this reservation of rights was found to be inapplicable when Section 60(d) is invoked. “Section 60(d) limits the control creators have over their works and therefore many photographers and others may find it troubling that Kneschke was unable to prevent the use of his photo,” said Ronak Kalhor-Witzel, counsel at Norton Rose Fulbright in Munich. She highlighted that this ruling could be concerning for creators who rely on the reservation of rights as a means to control the use of their work. The Photographer’s Response and Potential Appeal In his response, Kneschke expressed surprise at the court’s decision, particularly regarding the reliance on Section 60(d). “At the conciliation hearing, we were informed that more detailed submissions would be required in this regard and that a decision on this could only be made at a later date if necessary, ” Kneschke noted. He added that the court seemed to change its approach unexpectedly, leading to the dismissal of his case . Kneschke has indicated that he is considering an appeal, seeking to challenge the ruling and clarify whether creators can retain more control over the use of their work in AI training datasets. Implications for AI Development and Copyright Law This ruling could have far-reaching implications for AI developers and copyright holders across Europe. By relying on Section 60(d) , the court has essentially expanded the scope of AI training activities that can be considered scientific research , even if the datasets are eventually used by commercial entities. The case also raises important questions about the future of copyright protections in the EU, particularly as the EU AI Act approaches. Many legal experts are now questioning how the upcoming EU AI Act will intersect with copyright law . Kalhor-Witzel suggested that this ruling could set a precedent for how AI training is regulated in the EU , potentially limiting the ability of creators to prevent the use of their work in training datasets. “The ruling could affect the upcoming EU AI Act and raise questions about how copyright protections will be enforced in the context of AI training,” she said. Conclusion: A Precedent-Setting Ruling? While the court’s decision in favor of LAION has been described as “ legally sound ,” it has also created a sense of unease among creators who fear that their rights may be diminished in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies . Kneschke’s potential appeal will likely be closely watched, as it could either affirm or challenge the growing trend of allowing broader use of copyrighted works for AI training under scientific research exceptions. The case has highlighted the need for clarity on how copyright law will adapt to the age of AI, as creators and developers alike navigate the evolving legal landscape.

Innovation Vs. Regulation- The blocked bill would have required developers of advanced AI models to conduct safety testing, ensuring that their systems included a “kill switch” to deactivate any model posing a threat. The proponents, including Senator Scott Wiener , argued that this oversight was necessary for public safety, critics believed the bill’s broad application would stifle AI’s potential. Impact of the Veto- The veto was a setback for those advocating stronger regulation of AI, particularly in light of Congress’s failure to advance national AI regulations, but Newsom’s announcement of future plans to work with industry experts to develop safeguards for AI technology leaves the door open for future legislation, even as other states may attempt to pass similar regulations. On 29 th September 2024 , California Governor Gavin Newsom made headlines by vetoing a landmark AI safety bill that aimed to impose some of the first regulations on artificial intelligence in the United States and it was designed to protect the public from the growing risks associated with advanced AI technologies, but it also faced fierce opposition from the tech industry. So, Gavin Newsom’s decision has sparked a nationwide debate about the balance between innovation and regulation, especially in a state, this is known as a global leader in technological advancement. Why was the Bill Introduced? The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has been met with both excitement and concern, where AI systems are now capable of tasks ranging from language generation to image manipulation, and while the potential benefits are many, so are the risks associated with it. The blocked AI bill, authored by state Senator Scott Wiener , sought to address some of these risks by mandating stringent safety measures for the most powerful AI models, where the bill specifically required developers to- Conduct rigorous safety testing on AI models to ensure they operate within acceptable risk parameters. Incorporate a “kill switch” in AI systems to allow developers or companies to deactivate any model that could pose a danger. Ensure oversight for so-called “Frontier Models ”, which are the most powerful AI systems under development. The Governor’s Concerns Governor Newsom’s veto was primarily driven by concerns about innovation , where in his statement, Newsom argued that the bill’s requirements were overly broad , applying stringent safety protocols even to AI systems used for basic tasks and he feared that imposing such regulations could lead AI developers to flee California, taking their businesses to less regulated states or countries . Where, this, in turn, could have a bad effect on California’s tech industry, which is home to many of the world’s largest AI companies, including OpenAI and Google. Newsom was also worried about the impact on small AI startups that might lack the resources to comply with the bill’s safety standards and many in the tech industry echoed these concerns, with companies like OpenAI and Google warning that the legislation could stifle the development of critical AI technologies . Wei Sun, an analyst at Counterpoint Research , stated that AI is still in its early stages and argued that regulation at this point might be premature. The Role of Big Tech in the Veto It is impossible to ignore the influence of major tech companies in the debate over the AI safety bill as OpenAI, Google, and Meta were among the companies that posed opposition against the bill, arguing that the regulations would impede innovation . These companies have invested billions into the development of AI technologies and are keen to avoid any roadblocks that could slow their progress. The tech industry’s opposition however was not limited to private companies as it also found support among Democratic lawmakers in California , for example, former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued that the bill could harm California’s tech economy by discouraging investment in advanced AI models . Public Safety vs. Technological Advancement Despite the veto, many experts argue that the risks posed by AI warrant careful regulation as AI technologies are already being used in sensitive areas like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement, and the potential for misuse is real . Senator Scott Wiener, the author of the bill , warned that without binding regulations, AI companies are left to self-regulate and it’s a practice that has historically not worked in the public’s best interest. The supporters of the bill also pointed to Europe, where the European Union has taken a more proactive stance on AI regulation as the EU’s AI Act , which is set to be implemented in the coming years, will impose strict rules on the use of AI in high-risk applications , including the requirement that developers assess the potential impact of their technologies on human rights and safety. While the California bill did not go as far as the EU’s regulations, it was seen as a crucial first step in bringing transparency and accountability to the AI industry, but the critics of the veto argue that failing to regulate now could allow the technology to advance without adequate safeguards , leading to future crises related to privacy, job loss, and automation bias. What’s Next for AI Regulation in California ? Governor Newsom’s veto however does not mean the end of efforts to regulate AI in California, as alongside his veto, Newsom announced plans to collaborate with leading AI experts, including Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li , to develop alternative safeguards for the technology and these efforts are intended to address the same risks that the bill aimed to mitigate but without the rigid requirements that Newsom feared would stifle innovation . The failure of this bill moreover could also serve as a catalyst for other states to take action and as Tatiana Rice of the Future of Privacy Forum stated, lawmakers in other states may look to replicate or build upon California’s proposal because AI regulation is not going away, and the need for oversight will only grow as the technology becomes more pervasive. Conclusion The debate over California’s AI safety bill is a small part of the larger global conversation about how to regulate artificial intelligence, where on one hand, there is a clear need to mitigate the risks posed by powerful AI models, which could be used to cause harm or manipulate critical infrastructure, but on the other hand, the tech industry argues that overly restrictive regulations could slow innovation and push AI development outside of the U.S. This decision has however delayed efforts to regulate AI in California, but the conversation is far from over and as AI continues to evolve, the need for a balanced approach that protects public safety without stifling technological advancement will become increasingly urgent. The important actions promised by the governor could prove to be crucial in regulation of AI in future landscape.

Legal Ramifications Under the IT Act – In response to the complaint, an FIR was lodged under relevant sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act and while the offenders are minors, their actions fall under the category of serious cybercrime, and legal action was initiated accordingly. Growing Need for AI and Cyber Awareness in Schools – Children and teenagers are increasingly exposed to advanced technologies, but without proper guidance, they can easily misuse these tools as this incident shows how a lack of awareness about the ethical and legal ramifications of AI misuse can lead to devastating consequences, both for the offenders and the victims. In Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India , two school students from Class IX reportedly used AI tools to generate a morphed obscene image of their female teacher and according to Manish Saxena, the Station House Officer (SHO) of Civil Lines Police Station , the incident came to light when the teacher filed a complaint on 26 th September 2024. Based on the details of the case, the students used online AI platforms to create the manipulated image and subsequently shared it on various social media platforms and groups. This is alarming due to the young age of the offenders and the sophistication of the technology used. The Role of the IT Act This case involving the AI-generated obscene image of a teacher falls under several key provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 and one of the main sections that could apply is Section 66E , which deals with the violation of privacy. This provision addresses situations where images of a person are captured, transmitted, or published without their consent , particularly if the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy and although the image in this case was AI-generated, the unauthorized use and distribution of a manipulated image still constitute a violation under this section . The punishment for this offense includes imprisonment for up to 3 years, a fine of up to Rs. 2 lakhs, or both . Section 67 of the IT Act could also apply, as it penalizes the transmission or publication of obscene material online and this morphed image of the teacher qualifies as obscene under this provision, where the students’ act of sharing it on social media platforms further violates this section. The punishment for a first-time offense includes imprisonment for up to 3 years and a fine of up to Rs. 5 lakhs , with harsher penalties for repeat offenses. Apart from this, if the image depicted any sexually explicit content , Section 67A would come into play as this section criminalizes the distribution of material with sexually explicit content and can result in imprisonment of up to 5 years and a fine of up to Rs. 10 lakhs . Given that the accused are minors in the present case, they will be prosecuted under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 , which focuses on reformative rather than punitive measures, where the minors are likely to face actions such as counseling, community service, or placement in a juvenile reform home , as the law emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment for juvenile offenders. This could be said as a rather easy way out for the offenders in this case, with minimum or no repercussions whatsoever. The potential for misuse of AI tools AI tools have brought remarkable advancements to many fields, from healthcare to education, but this case highlights a growing concern about the potential misuse of AI technology, particularly in the hands of individuals with malicious intent or a lack of understanding of ethical boundaries . One of the most significant dangers is the ease of access to AI platforms that can create highly realistic manipulated images as many online tools allow users to generate images, videos, or even audio content that is indistinguishable from real content, leading to an increase in instances of cyberbullying, defamation, and revenge porn . This Moradabad case shows the real-world harm that can result from the misuse of such tools and as AI continues to evolve, incidents like these will likely become more frequent unless stricter regulations and safeguards are implemented, where for instance, developers of AI platforms could be required to integrate ethical usage guidelines or limit certain functionalities to prevent abuse, ensuring that AI tools are only used by those with proper education and understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Urgent need for Cyber Awareness in Schools One of the most significant lessons from this case is the urgent need for better cyber and AI education in schools as the students involved likely did not fully understand the gravity of their actions or the potential consequences of misusing AI tools. Many schools worldwide have begun to integrate lessons on cyber safety, privacy, and responsible digital behavior into their curriculums, but there is still a long way to go, particularly in India, where technology education often lags behind the rapid pace of technological advancements. The Psychological Impact on Victims For the victim, i.e. the female teacher in this case, the impact of such an incident is extensive, as being subjected to public humiliation, especially in the form of manipulated obscene images, can lead to immense psychological distress . Victims of such cyber offenses often experience anxiety, depression, and a loss of trust in the systems meant to protect them . The teacher in this case, however, took the brave step of approaching the police and filing a complaint, but many victims may feel too embarrassed or fearful to come forward, where it is also crucial for educational institutions to provide adequate support systems for victims of cyberbullying and image-based abuse. Counseling services, legal assistance, and the cooperation of law enforcement agencies are necessary to ensure that victims do not suffer in silence. Legal and Ethical Solutions This incident shows that, in order to address the growing concern of AI-generated content being misused, several legal and ethical solutions need to be considered and it may include- Stronger AI Regulations – Governments should work closely with AI developers to create regulations that prevent misuse as this could involve mandatory ethical training for users, especially young individuals, or restrictions on certain AI functionalities . Clear Legal Frameworks – While the IT Act in India does cover offenses related to obscene content, the rapidly evolving nature of AI technology demands that new laws specifically address AI-related crimes , where clear definitions and penalties for offenses involving AI manipulation must be established. Awareness Campaigns – Public awareness campaigns about the risks and legal consequences of misusing AI are essential, where the schools and communities must be educated about the potential dangers of AI manipulation, and students should be taught the importance of ethical technology use. Conclusion This case of the two Moradabad students misusing AI to harm their teacher serves as a wake-up call for society, and as AI technology continues to advance, our legal frameworks, ethical standards, and educational systems must advance as well. It is important that we address these issues now to prevent future incidents of AI misuse and ensure that such powerful tools are used responsibly. While the students involved in this incident will likely face legal consequences, this should serve as a stark reminder of the need for greater digital literacy and ethical responsibility in the age of AI.

According to an NCRB report, heart attack deaths in people under 30 have increased by 40 percent between 2018 and 2022, rising from 2,371 to 3,329. For those over 30, the increase was from 23,392 to 29,081. In the world of cardiology, many questions about cholesterol, statins (medication protecting people from cardiovascular diseases), and the choice between stents or bypass surgery have long sparked debate. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to change the conversation. By examining vast amounts of data , AI is offering new perceptions of heart health , transforming diagnostics, treatment decisions, and even preventive care . From predicting heart attacks to identifying hard-to-detect issues, AI is reshaping how we understand and treat heart disease. AI in Heart Attack Prediction One of the most exciting uses of AI is in predicting heart attacks. AI can evaluate coronary angiograms —the images of arteries used to detect blockages—and identify which plaques are likely to rupture and cause a heart attack. As Dr. Pothineni Ramesh Babu , Chief Interventional Cardiologist at Aster Ramesh Hospitals, explained, “ AI can now identify subtle abnormalities that the human eye might miss, making it an invaluable tool in preventing future cardiac events .” This ability to spot hidden risks could save lives by enabling doctors to intervene early, well before a heart attack occurs. The Stent vs. Bypass Debate AI is also contributing to the ongoing debate over stents and bypass surgery . For people with multivessel disease (MVD) , especially those with diabetes, bypass surgery has been shown to offer better long-term survival rates . Stents, while crucial during heart attacks, remain controversial in elective procedures. AI-driven analysis is helping doctors make more informed choices by providing clearer pictures of a patient’s condition and predicting the best course of action . AI, combined with evolving clinical guidelines, is tilting the balance toward surgery for many patients with complex heart conditions. The Hidden Threat of Silent Heart Disease Silent heart disease is another area where AI is making a big impact. Many patients, particularly in India, may have severe blockages without experiencing any symptoms. Traditional tests like electrocardiograms (ECG) or treadmill stress tests often fail to detect these hidden threats. “Even a patient with a 99 percent blockage may remain asymptomatic until it’s too late,” said Dr. Ramesh Babu. This is where AI-powered advanced imaging comes in. By improving the accuracy of cardiac CT scans, MRIs, and other imaging technologies, AI helps doctors find serious conditions that might otherwise go unnoticed. Smarter Diagnostics Through Machine Learning The complex nature of heart disease, with its many confounding variables, makes accurate diagnosis challenging. AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, is helping to sort through this complexity. These AI technologies are improving the ability to predict outcomes, particularly in patients with established heart disease. Advanced cardiac imaging technologies like intracoronary imaging are becoming more accurate thanks to AI, but there are still areas, like microvasculature and genetics , that remain poorly understood and present ongoing challenges. The Cholesterol and Statin Controversy AI is also shedding light on the long-standing cholesterol debate. While it’s well known that LDL cholesterol contributes to coronary artery disease , not all LDL particles are equally dangerous. Smaller, denser LDL particles are more harmful than larger, more buoyant ones. However, this distinction is often misunderstood by both patients and healthcare providers. As Dr. Ramesh Babu pointed out, “Statins do far more good than harm when prescribed properly, especially when started early in life.” Despite their proven benefits, fear of rare side effects continues to hold people back from accepting statins. AI is helping to address this issue by refining the understanding of how cholesterol behaves in the body and how treatments like statins can be used more effectively. Looking to the Future AI is still a growing field in cardiology, with many promising developments on the horizon. From better understanding genetic factors to uncovering the mysteries of how small blood vessels (microvasculature) function , AI is opening doors to new knowledge. As AI continues to evolve, its ability to improve diagnostics, refine treatments, and ultimately save lives will only grow stronger. The application of AI in cardiology is helping doctors make more accurate diagnoses, plan better treatments , and prevent heart attacks before they happen. Whether it’s examining imaging more precisely or predicting which patients are at the greatest risk, AI is a powerful tool that is revolutionizing heart healthcare. As Dr. Ramesh Babu highlighted, AI “makes it an invaluable tool in preventing future cardiac events.” With each advancement, AI is helping doctors get closer to a future where heart disease can be better managed and, ultimately, prevented.

The overarching theme— AI for Malaysia, AI for All —reflects the guidelines’ inclusive vision for AI’s role in advancing the nation’s future. III. Seven Core AI Principles In the National Guidelines for AI Governance and Ethics (AIGE) , seven core AI principles are established to promote the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence technology. These principles serve as a framework to ensure AI systems are developed ethically, safely, and with a human-centered focus. Fairness : AI must be developed to avoid bias or discrimination, ensuring equitable access and opportunities for all, irrespective of age, gender, religion, or ethnicity. AI solutions should not be one-size-fits-all and should be inclusive of diverse user needs. Reliability, Safety, and Control : AI systems must function as intended and be resilient against unauthorized access. Ensuring privacy, data protection, and system integrity throughout the AI lifecycle is critical. Developers should implement international standards for security and privacy, while users’ consent should be respected regarding data use. Privacy and Security : The systems must be strong and thoroughly tested for safety and reliability. This principle emphasizes the need for AI systems to handle unexpected scenarios while maintaining control. Proper testing, certification, and risk mitigation efforts are encouraged, especially in high-risk sectors such as autonomous vehicles and military applications. Inclusiveness : AI must be developed with an inclusive approach that addresses the needs of all societal segments, particularly vulnerable groups. AI solutions should be designed to benefit everyone, considering national needs and experiences, and developers should embrace diversity and inclusivity in AI decision-making processes. Transparency : Transparency is crucial to AI governance, ensuring AI algorithms and their decision-making processes are open for review and explanation. Stakeholders must be able to understand how AI systems work, the purpose of their use, the data they were trained on, and how decisions can be challenged. Accountability : Developers, AI owners, and operators must be accountable for their AI solutions. This includes taking responsibility for both successes and failures, and ensuring that the systems comply with ethical standards and governance. Key elements such as system purpose, technological capability, quality, and impact on sensitive users must be addressed. Pursuit of Human Benefit and Happiness : AI systems should prioritize enhancing human welfare and happiness, aligning with human-centered values. AI should be designed for the betterment of society, with mechanisms such as human-in-the-loop (HITL), human-on-the-loop (HOTL), and human-in-command (HIC) to ensure human oversight and prevent negative outcomes. These principles collectively emphasize building trustworthy AI systems that serve humanity’s best interests, ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency while promoting safety and inclusion. IV. Human Friendly AI Platform The Human-Friendly AI (HF-AI) Platform is an essential component in Malaysia’s effort to enhance AI development and adoption. Designed for operational efficiency and seamless user interaction, it provides immediate, 24/7 support to address queries, solve problems, and offer information without any delays or downtime. The platform enables automation of routine tasks, allowing human employees to focus on more complex strategic activities, which improves productivity while reducing operational costs. V. Guidelines for the Three Stakeholders- End users: One of the main objectives of the AIGE is to ensure that AI users understand their rights and responsibilities when engaging with AI technologies, as with this rapid advancement of AI applications, from virtual assistants to personalized marketing, users often interact with AI systems without fully comprehending the implications. The guidelines emphasize the importance of consumer protection principles that govern the interaction between users and AI technologies and a core focus of the guidelines for users is data privacy and protection . AIGE recommends that users should take proactive steps to safeguard their personal information themselves as well. The guidelines also provide recommendations on best practices when adopting AI technologies, which includes understanding the limitations of AI systems and how to identify biases in AI outputs , ensuring that users are aware of potential risks of using AI technology. Policymakers of Government Agencies, Organizations, and Institutions: Policymakers play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of AI governance and according to the AIGE, they are tasked with the responsibility of encouraging technological innovation while ensuring accountability and fairness. The recommendation provide for them is two fold that is first to embed a human-centric approach in the development and use of AI. This helps to ensure that AI technologies are designed to serve human needs while respecting human rights, focusing on transparency and fairness. Second, to develop comprehensive AI governance frameworks that address various dimensions, including risk mitigation . Developers, Technology Providers, and Suppliers: Developers, technology providers, and suppliers are at the forefront of AI innovation as they bear a significant responsibility to ensure that the AI systems they design, build, and deploy are fair, accountable, and transparent. One of the primary concerns is the issue of algorithmic bias as it can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, affecting marginalized communities or reinforcing existing societal inequalities . The guideline calls for developers to mitigate biases during the design and development phases and this involves testing AI models against diverse data sets and adopting techniques to ensure that outputs are representative and fair. The next recommendation for them is to monitor the AI performance , ensuring that the AI systems function as intended and comply with ethical standards. Lastly, data sharing between developers. The access to larger and more diverse data sets allows for the creation of AI systems that are more accurate and less prone to bias, but the AIGE also emphasizes that data sharing must be done in a manner that respects data privacy and security regulations , ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected. VI. The Importance of AI Governance in Malaysia’s Technological Landscape The publication of the National Artificial Intelligence Governance and Ethics Guidelines by MOSTI reflects Malaysia’s commitment to encourageing a responsible AI ecosystem and as AI continues to grow into various sectors, from healthcare and education to finance and transportation, the need for a comprehensive governance framework becomes increasingly critical. Keeping the focus on the rights and responsibilities of users, encouraging ethical development practices, and guiding policymakers in creating balanced regulatory environments, the AIGE serves as a blueprint for AI governance in Malaysia and it is a significant milestone in ensuring that the rapid growth of AI technology is matched with responsible and ethical practices. Conclusion As AI becomes an integral part of Malaysia’s digital future, the National Artificial Intelligence Governance and Ethics Guidelines published by MOSTI will play a pivotal role in shaping the country’s AI landscape as these guidelines provide a clear framework for end users, policymakers, and developers to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI technologies. Whether it’s the emphasis on data privacy, the focus on human-centric AI development, or the push for responsible innovation, the AIGE ensures that AI growth in Malaysia remains aligned with the broader goals of transparency, fairness, and accountability.

OpenAI agrees to provide access to OpenAI’s Training Data : In a suit filed on 24 th September, 2024 , against OpenAI for allegedly using copyrighted material to train their AI models, OpenAI will allow a select group to inspect its AI training datasets as part of a legal agreement and this will provide a rare opportunity to examine whether copyrighted works were used to train AI models. Meta Faces the similar lawsuit : The same plaintiffs that has filed the case against OpenAI, have also filed the case against Meta, for allegedly infringing on their copyright by using their copyrighted material to train their AI models. OpenAI, the birth company of ChatGPT is once again facing a copyright suit filed by various authors on 24 th September, 20024. The legal battle against OpenAI began when a group of famous authors, including Sarah Silverman, Paul Tremblay, and Ta-Nehisi Coates , filed lawsuits against OpenAI. These authors allege that OpenAI used their copyrighted works without consent to train its AI model such as ChatGPT. Their claim revolves around OpenAI’s acquisition of books from “shadow library” websites , which were allegedly used to feed ChatGPT the information required to generate text responses. The Plaintiffs argue that the use of such websites is directly infringing upon their copyright. The Authors have also accused OpenAI of “harvesting” their works from unauthorized sources and using them without compensation or credit . While the court dismissed some of their claims, such as unfair business practices and negligence, the core issue of direct copyright infringement remains intact and this has now become the focus of the case. Issues highlighted in the case One of the key issues in the case is whether OpenAI’s use of copyrighted materials falls under the umbrella of “fair use.” Under U.S. copyright law, fair use allows the use of copyrighted works without permission in certain cases, particularly when the new work is deemed “transformative.” As per the US Copyright laws, transformative work changes the original in such a way that it becomes something new and original, rather than merely replicating it. The authors also argue that the AI produces detailed summaries and analyses of themes found in their books also constitutes copyright infringement and this clash of interpretations will likely be a key battleground in the case. The Inspection Agreement A significant development in the case came with OpenAI’s unprecedented decision to provide access to its training data , where OpenAI, as part of an agreement reached between them and the plaintiffs, a team of experts representing the authors will be allowed to inspect the datasets used to train ChatGPT . This is the first time OpenAI has permitted external review of its training data, which could reveal whether copyrighted works were indeed used to develop its models. The inspection, however, will take place under strict conditions as the data will be made available only at OpenAI’s headquarters in San Francisco , and access will be heavily regulated. Only authorized individuals will be allowed to review the information, and they must sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to protect the confidentiality of the data. No technology, such as recording devices or even personal computers, will be allowed inside the inspection room and the process will be tightly controlled to ensure that no unauthorized copies of the data are made . The Implications for AI and Copyright Law The outcome of this case has the potential to establish landmark precedents in AI and copyright law and with the increasing adoption of AI technologies in various industries, the question of how these technologies are trained and whether they infringe upon copyrighted works has become an increasingly pressing issue. If the court rules in favor of the authors, it could force AI companies to rethink how they collect data for training as a victory for the plaintiffs might lead to tighter regulations around AI training datasets, requiring companies to seek explicit permission from copyright holders or pay for the use of copyrighted materials . This, in turn, could lead to a wave of new licensing agreements between content creators and AI developer s, but on the other hand, if OpenAI successfully argues that its use of copyrighted materials constitutes fair use, it could set a precedent that allows AI companies to continue using publicly available data, including copyrighted works, without seeking permission and this would significantly ease the legal burden on AI companies, allowing them to develop their models more freely. Similar Lawsuits Against Meta This case against OpenAI is not happening as the sole law suit, as the same group of plaintiffs has also filed lawsuits against Meta (formerly Facebook), alleging similar copyright infringements . Meta, like OpenAI, has been accused of using copyrighted works to train its AI models without permission from the authors as the outcome of both cases could have far-reaching consequences for the entire tech industry . AI companies, from large tech giants to startups, could face new legal challenges or be forced to adopt new practices to avoid copyright infringement claims and as AI continues to evolve, these cases could shape the future of how AI models are developed, trained, and used. Challenges Faced by the Authors’ Legal Team Despite the significance of the case, the authors’ legal team has faced challenges of its own as the U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria expressed concerns about whether the attorneys representing the authors were adequately advancing the case. His concerns were heightened by the lack of depositions taken by the plaintiffs’ team and a last-minute request for 35 depositions just days before the end of fact discovery . These procedural issues have put additional pressure on the plaintiffs’ legal team, as they race against time to prepare their case and the judge’s remarks show the importance of timing in litigation as the outcome of the case will likely depend not only on the legal arguments but also on how effectively the parties can gather evidence and present their case in court. Conclusion The case against OpenAI represents a critical moment for both the AI industry and copyright law, where AI technologies become increasingly integrated into everyday life, the question of how these systems are trained and the legality of their training data will only grow in importance. Whether OpenAI’s use of copyrighted works is deemed fair use or copyright infringement, it will set a precedent for future cases and could reshape how AI companies operate in the coming years as it’s a test of how society will balance innovation and creativity in the age of artificial intelligence.

With the capability to process over 1 trillion records daily, the system flags a staggering 100 million spam calls and 3 million spam messages in real-time , enhancing user experience and network security. Dual-Layered Protection : The solution utilizes a two-layered defense mechanism , with one filter at the network layer and another at Airtel’s IT systems level as this multi-layer approach enhances the detection accuracy, analyzing communication patterns and behaviors at both ends of the process. Advanced AI Technology and Machine Learning : Airtel’s state-of-the-art AI model employs machine learning algorithms that continually evolve based on data patterns and by examining parameters like caller behavior, messaging content, device changes, and usage anomalies, the tool delivers an impressive 97% accuracy rate for spam call detection and 99.5% for spam messages. Bharti Airtel (“Airtel”) has taken a bold step to combat the increasing menace of spam calls and messages by launching an AI-powered spam detection tool, where this innovative solution is the first of its kind in India , providing real-time protection to Airtel customers by identifying and flagging spam communications. In recent years, spam calls and messages have become an issue for telecom subscribers in India, disrupting daily life and posing security risks and this new AI-powered solution promises to address this concern comprehensively. It is developed in-house by Airtel’s data scientists and the proprietary algorithm scans all calls and messages , classifying them as either regular or suspected spam . How the Spam Detection System Works Airtel’s AI-powered solution offers a unique and advanced method of spam detection , relying on a dual-layered AI shield. The AI algorithm processes over 1 trillion records every day, using over 250 different parameters to detect spam as these parameters include the frequency of calls, call duration, frequency of device changes, and locations where the calls are made. It also factors in the number of missed calls and robocalling patterns , analyzing the frequency with which IMEI numbers change, which is a typical indicator of fraud Dual-Layered Protection System This dual-layered system ensures that every suspected spam communication is flagged and reported to subscribers, creating an effective level of protection. “In 2 milliseconds our solution processes 1.5 billion messages and 2.5 billion calls every day. This is equivalent to processing 1 trillion records on a real time basis using the power of AI. Our solution has been able to successfully identify 100 million potential spam calls and 3 million spam SMSes originating every day.” Gopal Vittal, managing director and CEO of Bharti Airtel, said during announcement of the system. It includes- Network Layer : Every call and SMS are first filtered through the network, analyzing various technical parameters. IT Systems Layer : Calls and messages then pass through a second AI-driven filter that evaluates behavioral patterns of callers and message senders. Automatic Activation One of the advantages of Airtel’s AI-powered spam detection system is its simplicity as the customers do not need to take any action to benefit from the service . The solution is automatically activated for all Airtel subscribers, whether prepaid or postpaid , at no additional cost and unlike third-party apps, the AI system works without the need for an internet connection. From 26 th September, 2024 onwards , Airtel subscribers will begin seeing a “Suspected Spam” banner on their phone screens when receiving potentially fraudulent calls and similarly, SMSes containing malicious links will be flagged as suspected spam. Protection Beyond Smartphones Airtel has also considered the large number of feature phone users in India , though they are still developing a version of the spam detection tool for these devices, where the smartphones will receive real-time alerts , Airtel is working on a solution for feature phones to ensure complete protection for all customers. Comparison with Third-Party Spam Detection Tools Airtel’s spam detection tool offers a more effective solution compared to popular apps like Truecaller as Gopal Vittal emphasized that the AI system does not rely on crowdsourced data like Truecaller , which depends on user feedback and requires an internet connection to function. Airtel’s system will operate in real-time and at the network level as mentioned before, where it filters spam calls and SMSes as soon as they are initiated, without the need for customer interaction and this specific feature, makes it a more reliable and accurate option for combating unwanted communications. Airtel has also clarified that its AI algorithm does not read the content of SMSes or record calls, but instead, it analyzes metadata, such as call frequency and SMS link content , to detect spam patterns. For instance, it flags SMSes with links by cross-referencing them against a central database of blacklisted URLs and this ensures that customer privacy is protected while providing maximum defense against malicious communications. Gopal Vittal also reassured customers that the system’s high accuracy rate minimizes false positives , ensuring genuine messages and calls are not blocked. Collaboration with Regulatory Authorities Airtel’s spam detection tool aligns with recent efforts by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to curb unsolicited communication as the TRAI has implemented strict rules, requiring telecom operators to block messages containing unverified links and APK files by October 2024 . As part of these regulations, Airtel is actively working with TRAI to ensure all registered senders comply with the new rules and more than 70,000 links have already been whitelisted , ensuring legitimate communications are not interrupted. As spam shifts from traditional calls and SMSes to over-the-top (OTT) apps like WhatsApp , Airtel’s solution may pave the way for similar AI-powered protections across other digital platforms. Conclusion With this introduction of its AI-powered spam detection system, Bharti Airtel has set a new standard for telecom providers in India and such innovative solution not only enhances the customer experience by reducing the flood of unwanted calls and messages, but it also demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to solve widespread problems. The system is however still open for improvements to be made, and as the system continues to learn and evolve, Airtel customers can look forward to a more secure and spam-free experience.

The EU AI Pact is not just about regulation but also focuses on innovation and through the various initiatives, the European Commission is laying the groundwork for fostering AI advancements that align with ethical and societal standards. What Is the EU AI Pact? The EU AI Pact is a voluntary framework encouraging companies to adopt ethical practices in the development and use of AI technologie s and with the AI Act set to be fully implemented within the next two years, the Pact serves as a bridge for companies to start aligning their AI systems with the regulations. These voluntary pledges represent the first significant step toward harmonizing AI development across the EU , ensuring that companies of all sizes, ranging from startups to large corporations, are contributing to the ethical evolution of AI. Signatories are asked to make three core commitments : AI Governance Strategy – Developing a strategy within the organization to foster AI development while ensuring compliance with upcoming regulations. High-Risk AI Systems Mapping – Identifying AI systems that are likely to be categorized as “high-risk” under the AI Act and preparing for their regulation. AI Literacy and Awareness – Promoting responsible AI use by educating employees on the ethical implications and risks associated with AI technologies. Additional Commitments Beyond the core commitments, more than half of the signatories have agreed to additional pledges , and these additional commitments demonstrate a growing consensus on the need for transparency, accountability, and human involvement in AI decision-making processes, especially as the technology becomes more deeply integrated into critical sectors like healthcare and finance. It includes- Ensuring human oversight in AI systems, especially in high-risk applications. Mitigating risks associated with AI misuse, such as bias or discrimination. Transparent labeling of AI-generated content, particularly deepfakes, to combat misinformation. Pillars of the EU AI Pact The structure of the EU AI pact revolves around a two-pillar system and these are crucial for understanding the core functionalities and purpose of the pact. It includes- Pillar I-Gathering and Exchanging Knowledge Key elements of this pillar are- Creation of a collaborative community for sharing experiences and challenges. Workshops organized by the AI Office to provide insights on the AI Act. Exchange of internal policies and strategies to help navigate AI regulation. Publication of best practices to promote transparency . Fosters collective learning and responsible AI development . Pillar II- Facilitating and Communicating Company Pledges Key elements of this pillar are- Encourages companies to voluntarily disclose AI compliance processes . “Declarations of engagement” demonstrate commitment to ethical AI use. Provides timelines for implementing required AI Act measures. Highlights actions on addressing high-risk AI systems and ensuring human oversight. Promotes early compliance with the AI Act, giving companies a head start. The Role of AI Factories and Other EU Initiatives In compliance with the regulatory efforts, the European Commission is also taking proactive steps to stimulate AI innovation across the continent . The AI Factories initiative , launched in September 2024 , offers a one-stop solution for startups and industry leaders to innovate, develop, and test AI applications. These AI Factories will provide essential resources such as: Access to high-quality data sets. State-of-the-art computing power. Expertise from AI specialists. These AI Factories aim to foster advancements in key sectors, including healthcare, automotive, and clean energy , by offering businesses a platform to develop and validate AI-driven solutions. Such initiative is part of a broader AI innovation package introduced earlier in 2024, which also includes financial support for AI startups through venture capital and equity measures. AI Grand Challenge and the European AI Research Council Another significant element of the EU’s AI strategy is the Large AI Grand Challenge , a competitive program offering financial support and access to Europe’s supercomputing infrastructure for innovative AI startups . Encouraging such competition and collaboration, the EU hopes to accelerate the development of groundbreaking AI technologies. The establishment of the European AI Research Council is another critical component as this council aims to oversee AI research and promote industrial applications of AI across Europe . Phased Implementation The AI Act will be implemented in phases over the next two to three years and certain prohibitions, such as those against harmful AI practices , will take effect within six months , while governance rules and obligations for general-purpose AI will become applicable after 12 months . Rules for AI systems embedded in regulated products however will take a longer time, up to 36 months to be fully enforced. Conclusion The EU AI Pact and the broader AI innovation initiatives represent a comprehensive approach to balancing innovation with ethical responsibility and by encouraging voluntary pledges, the EU is fostering a culture of trust and accountability in AI development while simultaneously boosting Europe’s leadership in AI innovation. As more companies join the Pact and commit to ethical AI development, the stage is set for the EU to become a global leader in both the regulation and advancement of artificial intelligence, where through initiatives like AI Factories and the European AI Research Council, the EU is not just preparing for the challenges of tomorrow but actively shaping the future of AI today.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "Europol’s Latest Report Defines the AI’s Role in Law Enforcement (25.09.2024)", "url": "https://justai.in/europols-latest-report-defines-the-ais-role-in-law-enforcement-25-09-2024/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights: AI’s Role in Modern Policing : Europol’s report, last updated on 23 rd September. 2024, illustrates how AI technologies such as facial recognition, predictive policing, and advanced data analytics are revolutionizing law enforcement as these tools enable faster identification of suspects, prevent crimes by analyzing past trends, and assist in locating missing persons. AI’s capacity to analyze large datasets in real time allows law enforcement to respond quickly to evolving situations, enhancing overall operational efficiency. Privacy and Civil Rights Concerns : The widespread use of AI in policing has sparked debates over privacy and civil liberties as Europol stresses that while AI can improve public safety, it poses significant risks of bias and misuse, particularly in facial recognition systems, which can lead to wrongful arrests and racial profiling. Regulatory Challenges and Innovations : The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act plays an important role in regulating AI in law enforcement as it imposes strict controls on real-time biometric identification, banning it in public spaces unless absolutely necessary for serious crimes. This law also fosters innovation through regulatory sandboxes, enabling the development of AI technologies under controlled conditions, ensuring they adhere to privacy and ethical standards. Europol’s latest report, titled “AI and Policing,” dives into the integration of AI-driven technologies into law enforcement and highlights both the benefits and challenges that come with this digital transformation. AI, particularly tools like facial recognition, predictive policing, and data analytics , is helping police forces enhance crime prevention, streamline investigations, and improve overall efficiency, but the use of AI in law enforcement raises ethical and legal questions, especially regarding privacy, bias, and the potential for mass surveillance. AI’s Contribution to Law Enforcement Enhanced Crime Prevention and Investigation – One of the major benefits of AI in policing is its ability to process vast amounts of data in real time . AI-powered tools allow law enforcement agencies to monitor surveillance footage, analyze social media activity, and track digital footprints at extraordinary speeds and these capabilities enable police to prevent crimes, solve cases faster, and identify criminal networks more effectively. For instance, facial recognition technology can help locate missing persons or suspects by comparing unidentified images against large databases. Predictive Policing – Another area where AI is making waves is predictive policing as AI algorithms can identify crime hotspots by analyzing past crime data and social patterns , helping law enforcement deploy resources more effectively. Such proactive approach can lead to significant reductions in crime rates in areas where early intervention is critical. Boosting Efficiency and Collaboration – AI tools can automate repetitive tasks , freeing up human officers to focus on more complex aspects of their work. Machine translation systems powered by AI moreover allow police to collaborate across borders seamlessly in international investigations. Ethical Concerns and Legal Challenges Despite the advantages, AI in policing is not without controversy and one of the major concerns highlighted by Europol is bias in AI algorithms . If not carefully monitored and regulated, AI systems can unreasonably target certain demographics, leading to instances of racial profiling and wrongful arrests. This is particularly concerning with facial recognition technologies , which studies have shown can have higher error rates for people of color . The use of AI, especially facial recognition in public spaces, has also sparked widespread concerns about privacy violations as critics argue that mass surveillance through AI infringes on individuals’ civil liberties and creates an environment where people are constantly monitored . The German Data Protection Conference (DSK), for instance, recently issued a resolution warning against the unrestricted use of live facial recognition , stating that it poses a serious threat to personal freedoms and fundamental human rights. The European Union’s AI Act reflects these concerns by limiting the use of real-time biometric identification in public spaces unless under strict legal frameworks. The Role of Regulations in AI Policing The EU’s recently adopted AI Act places stringent restrictions on AI use in policing , particularly focusing on real-time biometric identification. The Act bans the use of live facial recognition in public spaces unless for cases that involve high-ranking legal interests, such as combating terrorism and such regulation also represents the EU’s effort to strike a balance between harnessing the power of AI and protecting individual privacy rights. However, the Act also fosters innovation by creating “regulatory sandboxes,” where AI technologies can be tested in a controlled environment and these sandboxes offer a space for law enforcement to experiment with AI applications while ensuring they comply with ethical and legal standards. Europol emphasizes the importance of accountability and transparency when adopting AI-driven tools in policing . AI systems need to be transparent in their decision-making processes, and law enforcement agencies must be held accountable for their use of such technologies. The Growing Controversy Around Facial Recognition Technology Facial recognition technology (FRT) has become a focal point in the debate over AI in policing, where in countries like the UK, police forces are already experimenting with using live facial recognition at public events to identify suspects in real-time . Proponents argue that this technology can enhance public safety by swiftly locating individuals involved in criminal activities, but the critics warn of the dangers of mass surveillance, racial profiling, and wrongful identification . The controversy has led countries like Belgium to limit the use of facial recognition software to specific criminal investigations , reflecting the cautious approach some European nations are taking to balance public safety with privacy rights. Opposition to Unrestricted Use of AI in Policing Across the European Union, opposition to the widespread use of AI in policing is gaining momentum as the civil rights groups and privacy advocates are challenging the growing use of live facial recognition and other AI technologies, arguing that they erode personal freedoms and enable surveillance states . The German DSK’s resolution highlights the need for clear legal grounds before deploying such invasive technologies, ensuring that their use is limited to scenarios where they are absolutely necessary for protecting public safety. Europol’s Role in Shaping AI-Driven Policing Europol’s Innovation Lab plays a key role in exploring the potential of AI technologies in law enforcement and by working closely with EU law enforcement agencies , the Lab helps develop cutting-edge solutions tailored to operational needs. It focuses on promoting innovation while ensuring that AI adoption in policing aligns with ethical and legal standards . Europol’s Executive Director, Catherine De Bolle , has reiterated the organization’s commitment to responsible AI adoption, emphasizing that the transformative power of AI must be harnessed without compromising civil liberties. Conclusion As AI technologies continue to advance, their integration into law enforcement will likely expand, but this growth must be accompanied by strong regulatory frameworks to protect privacy, prevent discrimination, and ensure transparency. Europol’s report serves as a reminder that while AI can significantly enhance policing capabilities, its use must be approached with caution, balancing innovation with the preservation of civil liberties. Collaboration between law enforcement, technology developers, policymakers, and civil society will be essential to navigating the complex ethical and legal challenges AI poses in the policing landscape of the future.

Promoting AI literacy is essential for ensuring that future generations are equipped with the knowledge and skills to thrive in an AI-driven world. Challenges Hindering AI Adoption in the Public Sector Despite the enormous potential, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of AI in the public sector. Complex Public Procurement Processes – Public procurement is a major barrier to AI adoption as governments often struggle with burdensome administrative requirements and lack clarity when specifying their AI needs. The process also frequently emphasizes cost-saving measures over the quality of AI services , further impeding progress. Data Management Difficulties – AI relies heavily on large datasets, but insufficient access to high-quality data and poor data governance hampers its implementation. Public sector organizations often face difficulties in s haring data across boundaries and ensuring proper data ownership , both of which are essential for AI’s success. Regulatory Ambiguities – One of the primary obstacles to AI adoption is the lack of clear regulatory frameworks as governments struggle to define the liability for AI systems, and many AI applications remain untested due to limited regulatory spaces or “sandboxes” where they can be experimented with safely. There are also concerns about AI’s decision-making processes being opaque, making it difficult to ensure accountability. Bias and Transparency Concerns – The potential for AI systems to introduce biases in decision-making is a significant concern and the report notes that without proper checks and balances, AI could spread and even worsen existing societal biases , where ensuring transparency and explainability in AI systems is essential for maintaining public trust. Policy Recommendations The European Commission’s report outlines several policy recommendations to accelerate AI adoption in the public sector and these policies aim to address the challenges mentioned above while promoting human-centric, trustworthy AI systems. Increasing Funding and Resources – To enable AI to thrive in public services, governments need to increase funding and resources dedicated to AI research and development and this should focus not only on developing new AI technologies but also on improving public procurement processes to facilitate AI adoption. Ensuring Transparency and Accountability – Building trust in AI systems is critical for their success in the public sector, so governments must prioritize transparency in AI operations and ensure that these systems are held accountable for their decisions . Establishing clear regulatory frameworks that define AI liability and require explainability in AI systems is essential for fostering this trust. Promoting Cross-Border Data Sharing – Data is the lifeblood of AI, and public sector organizations need better mechanisms for sharing data across national and organizational boundaries . The report recommends promoting cross-border data sharing to create a more effective and integrated AI ecosystem within the EU. Aligning Industry and Public Sector Expectations – Bridging the gap between industry innovation and public sector needs is crucial for the success of AI adoption, so governments must work closely with AI developers to ensure that public sector AI systems meet the specific needs of citizens while aligning with broader industry trends . Promoting Human-Centric AI Solutions – The EU has consistently emphasized the importance of creating human-centric AI solutions and this means developing AI systems that are designed with ethical considerations at their core and that prioritize the well-being of citizens . The report encourages governments to continue pursuing AI solutions that are not only efficient but also trustworthy and sustainable. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize public services across the EU, making governments more efficient, transparent, and responsive to citizen needs. Unlocking this potential however requires overcoming several challenges, including complex retention processes, data management issues, and regulatory ambiguities. By following the policy recommendations outlined in the European Commission’s report, the EU can position itself as a global leader in trustworthy AI adoption. With a focus on human-centric solutions, transparent operations, and cross-border collaboration, the future of AI in the EU’s public sector looks promising.

California Leads in AI Regulation : California, home to many of the world’s top AI companies, is at the forefront of addressing AI-related issues with groundbreaking laws. Governor Gavin Newsom has already signed eight AI-related bills into law , with more in the pipeline, making the state a leader in AI governance. A Pivotal AI Bill : Senate Bill 1047, currently awaiting Governor Newsom’s decision, is a landmark piece of legislation requiring AI developers to implement safeguards against catastrophic harm from advanced AI models. While controversial, it could shape the future of AI regulation. California, as the global epicenter of AI innovation, is making a bold move by implementing laws that address the societal impacts of AI. Governor Gavin Newsom is currently considering 38 AI-related bills , including the highly debated SB 1047 , aimed at safeguarding against the dangers of advanced AI systems. The Deepfake Dilemma One of the most alarming applications of AI has been the creation of deepfake nudes, where AI-generated images of individuals without their consent were circulated and such technology can be weaponized for blackmail, harassment, and reputation damage . Recognizing this threat, Governor Newsom signed two crucial bills into law on 19 th September, 2024 and these reflect California’s strong stance on privacy protection, as they hold perpetrators accountable and force platforms to be more vigilant: SB 926: Criminalizes the act of blackmailing individuals using AI-generated nude images that resemble them and this landmark law aims to deter individuals from exploiting AI in this harmful way. SB 981 : Mandates that social media platforms create mechanisms for reporting deepfake nudes, where platforms must investigate reported content and take down any confirmed AI-generated nudes , ensuring user protection from malicious AI usage. AI-Generated Content Disclosure A significant concern with AI technologies is the seamless blending of AI-generated and real content and to address this, California has introduced SB 942 , signed by Newsom on 19 th September, 2024 which mandates that AI systems disclose when content is AI-generated . This law requires AI-generated content to include watermarks or metadata that clearly indicate its AI origins . For example, images produced by AI tools like DALL-E must now contain information in their metadata revealing that they were AI-generated as the goal of this law is transparency. As AI tools become increasingly powerful, they blur the line between reality and fiction and by mandating that AI-generated content is labeled, California hopes to help users identify such content and prevent its misuse in areas like journalism, entertainment, and social media. Election Integrity Another crucial area of concern is the potential for AI to disrupt democratic processes . AI-generated deepfakes can be used to spread misinformation during elections, swaying public opinion and misleading voters . So, three new laws signed by Governor Newsom directly address this issue as these aim to preserve the integrity of the electoral process in the age of AI, recognizing the severe consequences of unchecked AI influence on democracy: AB 2655 : Requires large social media platforms to remove or label AI-generated deepfakes related to elections and failure to comply allows candidates to seek injunctive relief. AB 2839 : Targets individuals who post or repost AI deepfakes intended to deceive voters and such law was enacted immediately, and even high-profile individuals, like Elon Musk, may be affected by this. AB 2355 : AI-generated political advertisements must now disclose that the content is AI-generated and this helps ensure transparency in political advertising, making it harder for voters to be misled by AI-generated content. Actors vs AI The entertainment industry has also been affected by AI, as studios explore creating digital replicas of actors, sometimes without their consent and with concerns growing over the use of AI to generate lifelike representations of actors, California has stepped in to ensure performers’ rights are protected. Governor Newsom signed two laws on 17 th September, 2024 that focus on this issue and these have been championed by SAG-AFTRA, the nation’s largest actors’ union , as they help establish clear boundaries around the use of AI in the entertainment industry: AB 2602 : Requires studios to obtain explicit permission from actors before creating AI-generated replicas of their likeness or voice. AB 1836 : Prohibits studios from creating digital replicas of deceased actors without the consent of their estates , safeguarding the legacy of performers. The Senate Bill 1047 The most contentious AI-related bill on Governor Newsom’s desk is Senate Bill 1047 , also known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act . This bill is at the center of a broader debate on how best to regulate AI while promoting innovation as it requires AI developers to integrate safeguards into advanced AI models to prevent catastrophic harms, such as large-scale privacy violations, or even existential threats posed by runaway AI systems. The California attorney general would have the power to enforce these regulations , holding developers accountable if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. However, the bill has met with significant opposition from AI companies, who argue that: The bill’s definition of “covered models” is too rigid and doesn’t allow for technological advancements. It’s unfair to hold AI developers responsible for how others might misuse their technology. The bill could stifle innovation, particularly for smaller AI startups that may struggle to meet compliance requirements. Despite these concerns, proponents argue that regulating AI is essential to prevent potential disasters and a veto on SB 1047 could signal reluctance to impose any meaningful restrictions on AI technologies, leaving society vulnerable to unchecked AI risks . Governor Newsom’s decision on SB 1047, due by the end of September , will have significant implications for the future of AI regulation in the United States. Conclusion California’s proactive approach to AI regulation is shaping the future of how this powerful technology will be governed and from combatting deepfake nudes to ensuring election integrity, the state is taking bold steps to address the immediate risks posed by AI. SB 1047 stands out as a pivotal moment in this effort, as its success or failure could determine how far the state and the nation is willing to go in regulating AI. As AI continues to evolve, California’s actions will serve as a blueprint for other governments, offering valuable lessons on how to navigate the complex balance between innovation and safety.

Still, similar to other nations, Algeria is just beginning to realize the importance of Artificial Intelligence in various sectors including industries, health, and governance. As the focus in Algeria has been on transitioning into a digital and technological era, such a focus may eventually be concentrated on more specific regulations related to AI. Algeria is invested through a Data Protection Law , or specifically, by Law No. 18-07, 2018 , which governs the collection, processing, and storage of personal data—probably not AI-specific but potentially impacts AI applications, particularly those with personal data. It is aimed at governing the protection of personal data, marking a wide step toward compliance with global standards of data protection, since it lays down rules comprehensively regarding how personal data is supposed to be collected, processed, stored, and shared, making sure that respect is given to the right to privacy of the individual. Another significant step taken by the African Union is to come up with the AI Data Policy Framework of 2022 that deals with the flow of Data for AI-based technologies. The AI Data Policy Framework 2022 complements the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy by focusing on using the transformative potential to benefit African nations, considering that the main interest is creating a trusted, secure, and harmonized data governance system across the continent. Another key element is the promotion of free cross-border data flows, thereby ensuring the movement of data moves without any obstacle within Africa, while at the same time being protected with robust safeguards against privacy violations and national security risks. The policy also aims to see that the gains from using the data are equitably distributed in different regions and populations in Africa and in furtherance of this, the framework promotes strong institutions for governance of overseeing data management in such a way that responsible and innovative use is combined with due respect for human rights.

Several factors would probably limit the development of AI regulations in Chad: among them, low digital infrastructure, low levels of technological adoption, and other pressing socio-economic challenges. Chad, having one of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world has a major hindrance to the acceptance and regulation of AI technologies. While the government of Chad does show interest in the realm of digital technologies, it has so far not made any public declarations or published any efforts targeted at AI and any existing digital policy framework for this country would more likely focus on basic ICT infrastructures and education rather than advanced technologies like AI. Chad is a member of numerous regional organizations that have just started discussing AI and digital policy at the continental level, particularly through the African Union and these may feed into Chad’s approach to AI regulation.

Google’s Trademark Application Rejection – Despite having its trademark application for “GEMINI” rejected by the USPTO , Google proceeded with the rebranding, allegedly disregarding Gemini Data’s rights. David vs. Goliath – The case showcases the imbalance of power in intellectual property disputes, with Gemini Data challenging one of the world’s largest tech companies over its “GEMINI” brand. In February 2024 , Google made headlines when it announced a rebranding of its AI tools, by renaming its BARD chatbot and other AI services under the new name “GEMINI” and what followed was a legal battle that could have lasting implications for intellectual property law in the tech industry. Gemini Data Inc., a smaller AI company , has accused Google of trademark infringement, filing a lawsuit on 11 th September, 2024 , alleging that the tech giant intentionally violated their rights to the “GEMINI” trademark despite being aware of its existence and importance to Gemini Data’s brand. Google’s Rebranding In early 2024, Google unveiled its rebranded AI platform, switching from the BARD name to “GEMINI” as part of a broader strategy to integrate its generative AI tools under a unified brand . Google’s “GEMINI” branding was seen as a fresh direction for the company, capitalizing on the popularity of AI tools that allow users to query massive data sets using natural language, but this move quickly sparked controversy when Gemini Data Inc., a company specializing in enterprise AI solutions, claimed that Google’s new branding infringed on its trademarked “GEMINI” name. Gemini Data had been operating its AI platform under the “GEMINI” brand for several years, developing a strong reputation and gaining significant market traction and the company’s products allow businesses to engage with complex data systems via natural language queries, making it a direct competitor in the growing field of AI tools . Given this overlap, the dispute is centered around whether Google had the legal right to use the “GEMINI” name for its own AI tools​. Legal Grounds for the Lawsuit The lawsuit, filed by Gemini Data Inc in a federal court in San Francisco , argues that Google deliberately infringed on its trademark rights by adopting the “GEMINI” brand for its AI tools and according to the complaint, Google was aware of Gemini Data’s trademark , as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) had rejected Google’s trademark application for the “GEMINI” name in May 2024 due to the likelihood of confusion with existing trademarks, including that of Gemini Data. Gemini Data’s legal team emphasized that Google’s actions were not only unlawful but also a calculated attempt to override the rights of a smaller competitor as the complaint outlines how Google had allegedly attempted to acquire Gemini Data’s trademark through a third-party intermediary before the rebranding was announced . When these negotiations fell through, Google proceeded with the rebranding anyway, leading to the current legal battle. A David vs. Goliath Scenario One of the dominant themes in this case is the imbalance of power between small companies and large corporations in the trademark law . Trademark laws are designed to protect businesses’ brand identities, ensuring that their names and logos are not used by competitors in ways that could confuse customers or dilute their brand value. However, as this case demonstrates, even with legal protections in place, smaller companies often face uphill battles when challenging the actions of powerful corporations. In its lawsuit, Gemini Data has painted a picture of Google as a company that knowingly disregarded trademark laws, assuming that a smaller competitor would be unable to fight back effectively and by moving forward with the “GEMINI” branding despite having its trademark application denied and being aware of Gemini Data’s exclusive rights , Google appears to be leveraging its vast resources and influence to push ahead with its branding strategy, regardless of the legal implications. History of Trademark Disputes This is not the first time Google has found itself at the center of a trademark dispute as in 2009, the company faced a backlash when it named its new programming language “Go,” which clashed with the pre-existing “Go!” programming language . Similarly, Meta (formerly Facebook) faced legal action over its name change , highlighting the growing challenges tech giants face as they expand into new markets with limited availability of original brand names​. While trademark disputes are not uncommon in the tech industry, the Gemini Data lawsuit raises the stakes by involving generative AI tools , a rapidly evolving sector where intellectual property protection is becoming increasingly complex and as more companies race to develop AI technologies, the question of who has the right to use certain brand names and trademarks will only become more critical. The Legal Implications and Potential Outcomes If the Gemini Data prevails in this lawsuit, the legal implications could be far-reaching as a victory for the smaller company would not only force Google to rebrand its AI tools again but could also lead to significant financial penalties . The case could also set a precedent for how trademark disputes involving AI technologies are handled in the future , especially when larger corporations are accused of infringing on the rights of smaller competitors. On the other hand, if Google successfully defends its use of the “GEMINI” name, it could encourage other tech giants to adopt similar strategies when navigating trademark disputes and this outcome would likely raise concerns among smaller companies about their ability to protect their intellectual property against the overwhelming market power of larger competitors. Conclusion The lawsuit between Gemini Data Inc and Google represents more than just a trademark dispute as it highlights the broader challenges of protecting intellectual property in the rapidly evolving field of AI . As AI technologies become more integrated into everyday life, the importance of clear and enforceable trademark protections will only grow, but for now, the outcome of this case remains uncertain, but it will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on both the legal landscape and the competitive dynamics of the AI industry . Whether this case results in a rebranding for Google or a loss for Gemini Data, it shows the importance of vigilance and legal preparedness in the world of trademarks and intellectual property, particularly as new technologies continue to reshape the market.

This nomination follows a period where the EU has aggressively worked to regulate Big Tech through landmark legislations such as the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). Oversight of Big Tech : Virkkunen’s role places her at the forefront of regulating Big Tech’s activities in Europe. The Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) are two of the most ambitious regulatory frameworks the European Union has introduced to tackle the growing influence of tech giants. The DSA requires platforms like Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms. Focus on Digital Innovation : In addition to regulating Big Tech, Virkkunen’s portfolio focuses on nurturing digital innovation within Europe and this aspect of her role is crucial for achieving Europe’s long-term vision of tech sovereignty. Europe’s reliance on American and Chinese tech companies has been a point of concern, particularly in areas like data privacy, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G infrastructure. Henna Virkkunen, a seasoned Finnish lawmaker , has recently been nominated to serve as the European Union’s Executive Vice President for Tech Sovereignty, Security, and Democracy . Her rise to this pivotal role comes at a crucial time, as Europe continues its efforts to regulate Big Tech and foster homegrown digital innovation. Virkkunen’s journey in politics spans several portfolios, from education and transport to public administration, which has helped her develop the necessary expertise to tackle the complex challenges of digital regulation. A New Approach to Big Tech Regulation Henna Virkkunen will oversee the enforcement of two landmark legislations: the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) , where both of the acts were introduced to ensure that large technology firms, such as Meta, Google, and Amazon, comply with stringent regulations regarding market dominance and content moderation. The Digital Services Act focuses on making sure tech giants take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and this includes the need to curb illegal and harmful content and ensure that user privacy is maintained. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are already under scrutiny due to child safety concerns , and under Virkkunen’s leadership, these investigations are expected to intensify. The Digital Markets Act meanwhile aims to limit the overwhelming power of Big Tech companies by ensuring fair competition and the companies that have been labeled as “gatekeepers” under the DMA, such as Apple and Google , are required to allow smaller competitors to access markets on fair terms and this includes opening up payment systems, app stores, and ad models to ensure that European startups and smaller players have a level playing field. Strengthening Europe’s Tech Competitiveness One of the main aspects of Virkkunen’s portfolio is tech sovereignty . Europe has long relied on American and Chinese tech giants, which raises concerns about security, privacy, and competitive disadvantages for European companies. Virkkunen aims to change this dynamic by supporting the growth of European tech champions where companies like Nokia and Rovio , the makers of the popular Angry Birds game , are examples of homegrown talent that she will seek to promote. Virkkunen’s appointment is seen as a boon for Finland , given its rich history of tech innovation as Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo emphasized that her role will help strengthen the nation’s focus on security and competitiveness . The country is home to not only Nokia but also several other high-tech companies that stand to benefit from policies aimed at reducing Europe’s dependency on foreign technology​. AI and the Future of Regulation Another critical part of Virkkunen’s new role is overseeing the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Act , which the European Union adopted in 2024 as this act places specific limitations on the use of AI, especially in areas that impact fundamental human rights, such as surveillance, facial recognition, and biometric data, as with concerns growing over how Big Tech companies utilize AI for profit and control, Virkkunen will lead efforts to ensure that these companies remain transparent and ethical in their AI practices​. Addressing the Broadband Infrastructure A significant part of Virkkunen’s mandate is to push forward the Digital Networks Act , which aims to improve Europe’s digital infrastructure and this includes boosting high-speed broadband coverage , a move that is particularly welcomed by the telecommunications sector. Tech companies have long advocated for more effective digital networks, and now with Europe aiming to strengthen its tech sovereignty, ensuring the proper infrastructure is in place is a critical step​. This is however not just about expanding broadband and there is likely to be a renewed debate over whether Big Tech should shoulder the part of the costs for such infrastructure , given their immense use of network bandwidth . Companies like Google and Amazon rely heavily on digital infrastructure to deliver their services, and many policymakers argue that they should contribute more significantly to the rollout of high-speed internet​. Conclusion Henna Virkkunen’s appointment as the European Union’s Executive Vice President for Tech Sovereignty, Security, and Democracy marks a new chapter in Europe’s digital regulation efforts. Her extensive experience, combined with a clear mandate to oversee groundbreaking legislation, positions her to shape the future of tech in Europe. The enforcement of the DSA and DMA , the push for a more equitable and transparent AI landscape, and the development of robust digital infrastructure are just a few of the significant challenges she will face. As Europe strives to establish itself as a leader in tech innovation while curbing the dominance of external powers, Virkkunen’s leadership will undoubtedly play a crucial role in achieving these ambitious goals.

Crowdsourced questions and peer review: One of the unique and revolutionary aspects of “Humanity’s Last Exam” is its collaborative approach to constructing the test itself. The exam will feature over 1,000 questions, with submissions coming from a global pool of participants and the questions, however, are not just any regular queries but are specifically designed to challenge AI models at an expert level. Avoiding weapon-related questions: One of the most important restrictions that the organizers of “Humanity’s Last Exam” have imposed is the exclusion of questions related to weapons as this decision comes in response to concerns about the potential misuse of AI in military or harmful contexts. The artificial intelligence (AI) domain is rapidly evolving and the need for more advanced testing mechanisms is growing exponentially as the recent developments, such as OpenAI’s latest model, have shown impressive leaps of AI in performance, crushing previously challenging benchmarks. These advancements however need mechanisms so that we can continue to measure the true intelligence of these systems and this is where “Humanity’s Last Exam” comes in. This is spearheaded by the Center for AI Safety (CAIS) and Scale AI and it aims to create the most comprehensive and challenging AI exam ever devised. The goal is to evaluate when AI systems achieve expert-level capabilities and ensure these tests remain relevant as AI technology continues to advance. The Rise of AI In recent years, AI systems have achieved significant milestones where OpenAI’s new model, OpenAI o1 , has “destroyed” many reasoning benchmarks that were once thought to be formidable. Dan Hendrycks , the executive director of CAIS and advisor to Elon Musk’s xAI startup , highlighted this rapid progress in AI performance as he co-authored two influential papers in 2021 that set the foundation for testing AI systems on undergraduate-level knowledge in subjects like U.S. history and competition-level math . These tests are now widely used, with the datasets being some of the most downloaded on AI platforms like Hugging Face and while AI systems were initially giving random answers to questions on these exams, they are now acing them, pushing the boundaries of what we thought AI could do. However, as AI systems improve on traditional tests , these benchmarks become less effective at truly measuring their capabilities and this is where “Humanity’s Last Exam” seeks to fill the gap. A New Era of AI Testing “Humanity’s Last Exam” is a novel project that aims to assess AI’s expert-level capabilities in a more sophisticated and challenging manner. The exam will include over 1,000 crowd-sourced questions that are difficult for non-experts to answer and such questions, due by 1 st November, 2024, will undergo peer review, with top submissions being rewarded with co-authorship opportunities and prizes of up to $5,000, sponsored by Scale AI. According to Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI , there is a desperate need for more challenging tests to measure AI progress as this sentiment is echoed by Hendrycks, who believes that many of the current tests are too simplistic for today’s AI models. While AI systems are excelling at benchmarks involving traditional knowledge-based questions, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring more abstract reasoning and planning. “Humanity’s Last Exam” will focus on these more complex cognitive tasks , which many experts believe to be better measures of intelligence. The Importance of Abstract Reasoning in AI Testing Abstract reasoning , a key focus of “Humanity’s Last Exam,” is often cited as one of the most reliable indicators of true intelligence . AI models have demonstrated exceptional performance in knowledge-based reasoning but have fallen short in tasks that require planning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition, as for instance, OpenAI o1 , despite excelling in many areas, scored only around 21% on a visual pattern-recognition test known as ARC-AGI. Many AI researchers argue that these types of tasks, especially those that involve abstract reasoning and planning are more indicative of a system’s true intelligence and by designing questions that emphasize abstract reasoning, “Humanity’s Last Exam ” seeks to push AI systems beyond their current capabilities. Memorization vs. Intelligence One of the main challenges in designing AI tests is ensuring that the questions truly assess intelligence, rather than the model’s ability to memorize answers as many popular benchmarks have been used to train AI systems, making it difficult to assess whether an AI model genuinely understands a question or is merely recalling answers from its training data. To address this concern, Hendrycks and his team plan to keep certain questions from “Humanity’s Last Exam” private , ensuring that AI models cannot simply memorize the answers as this will provide a more accurate measure of the AI’s problem-solving and reasoning abilities. The Ethical Dimension While “Humanity’s Last Exam” seeks to challenge AI systems, the organizers have placed one significant restriction on the types of questions allowed that specifically forbids questions about weapons and this decision is grounded in ethical concerns regarding AI’s potential to be used for harmful purposes. Hendrycks and Wang both agree that introducing AI to questions about weapons would pose too great a risk, especially given the potential consequences of AI systems gaining expertise in this area as it reflects the broader ethical discussions surrounding AI development. As AI systems become more powerful, it is crucial to consider the societal impact and ensure that these technologies are developed responsibly. Implications for AI Development The results of “Humanity’s Last Exam” could have far-reaching implications for the future of AI development and if AI systems can pass these expert-level tests, it would signal a major shift in the way we understand and interact with artificial intelligence . These results would also guide the next steps in AI safety and regulation, as society grapples with the implications of AI systems that can reason and plan at expert levels. The project will also provide valuable insights into how far AI has come and how much further it still has to go, and by focusing on abstract reasoning and problem-solving, “Humanity’s Last Exam” will offer a clearer picture of AI’s true capabilities and limitations , helping to shape the future of AI research. Conclusion “Humanity’s Last Exam” represents a bold new frontier in AI testing. As AI continues to advance, projects like this are essential to ensuring that we can accurately measure and understand the capabilities of these powerful systems and by focusing on expert-level reasoning and ensuring the integrity of the tests, “Humanity’s Last Exam” aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of AI’s progress. As we look toward the future, the results of this project will play a crucial role in shaping the next phase of AI development and ensuring that these technologies are developed in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "Open AI unveils its secret project ‘Strawberry’: Can it think before responding?", "url": "https://justai.in/open-ai-unveils-its-secret-project-strawberry-can-it-think-before-responding/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights: Advanced Reasoning Capabilities: OpenAI o1 is designed to handle complex, high-level problems, particularly in math, coding, and scientific fields. The model uses a “chain-of-thought” process that mirrors human-like reasoning, breaking down tasks step by step before generating a response. Specialized but Limited Features: Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, OpenAI o1 lacks several key features found in other models like GPT-4o as it is currently limited to text-based inputs, meaning it cannot browse the web, process images, or handle multimodal inputs like GPT-4o. Users who want to upload files or images for analysis will not find this functionality in o1. Higher Cost for Specialized Tasks: OpenAI o1’s advanced capabilities come at a premium. Priced higher than general-purpose models like GPT-4o, the o1 model reflects its specialization in academic and technical fields. OpenAI charges $15 per 1 million input tokens and $60 per 1 million output tokens for the o1 API, making it a costly tool for users who need precision in specialized areas like coding or PhD-level research. On 12 th September, 2024 , OpenAI officially unveiled its latest AI model, OpenAI o1 , previously codenamed “Strawberry” and this marks a significant step forward in the world of artificial intelligence, particularly for tasks requiring advanced reasoning and problem-solving. Unlike the more versatile GPT-4o, which is widely known for handling a broad range of general tasks, OpenAI o1 targets specific domains, excelling in mathematics, coding, and science . The Core of OpenAI o1 OpenAI o1 introduces a “chain-of-thought” process that allows the model to reason through problems step by step, a feature absent in previous models and this is crucial for tackling complex, multistep problems. For example, in coding or solving high-level math problems, breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps increases accuracy and reduces errors. The chain-of-thought process significantly improves o1’s reasoning abilities, especially in scenarios requiring logic and deduction. In benchmarks, o1 has demonstrated superior performance in coding tasks, placing in the 89th percentile on Codeforces, a competitive programming platform and it also outperformed human-level accuracy in PhD-level science questions across fields like physics, biology, and chemistry. These results highlight how o1 surpasses general-purpose models when it comes to in-depth reasoning. Specialization in Complex Domains The primary strength of OpenAI o1 lies in its ability to handle complex, domain-specific tasks and whether it’s solving advanced math problems or generating intricate code, o1’s reasoning capabilities make it an invaluable tool for specialized tasks. According to OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman , the model’s ability to “think” before responding allows it to excel in tasks that require logical precision, such as scientific research and programming. OpenAI o1’s multilingual capabilities also stand out, making it useful in academic and professional settings where multiple languages are used and such improvement positions it as an essential tool for researchers and developers worldwide. Limitations of OpenAI o1 Lack of Multimodal Input : OpenAI o1 can only process text inputs, unlike GPT-4o, which handles text, images, and video. Users now cannot upload images or files for analysis, limiting its use in fields like creative industries and data-heavy Slower Processing : The model dedicates time to reasoning, which slows down its processing speed and this can be frustrating for users who require quick responses for general-purpose tasks. Higher Cost : OpenAI o1 is more expensive compared to GPT-4o, reflecting its advanced capabilities in specific tasks as pricing starts at $15 per 1 million input tokens and $60 per 1 million output tokens , significantly higher than GPT-4o. OpenAI o1 vs. GPT-4o A comparison between OpenAI o1 and GPT-4o highlights that these models serve distinct purposes and while GPT-4o is a more versatile, general-purpose AI capable of handling a broad range of tasks, OpenAI o1 is more specialized. GPT-4o is ideal for everyday tasks like text generation, basic coding, and multimodal tasks like image analysis but on the other hand, OpenAI o1 is the preferred choice for advanced academic tasks or intricate programming challenges that require detailed reasoning​. A Costly but Valuable Tool OpenAI o1’s specialized features come with a higher price tag and while GPT-4o offers affordable, versatile solutions for a wide range of users, o1 is more expensive. Its higher cost reflects its targeted capabilities, which are most useful in academic, scientific, and high-level coding contexts. However, for users who need these advanced features, o1 represents significant value despite the price and there is also an o1-mini version, which offers a cheaper alternative for users who don’t need the full capabilities of the original model. While o1-mini lacks some of the advanced features, it still benefits from the same reasoning improvements seen in the full version. Conclusion OpenAI o1 is a major leap forward in AI, particularly in its reasoning capabilities and by allowing the model to think before responding, OpenAI has created a tool that excels at tasks requiring advanced problem-solving and logic. Although o1 is still limited in some respects such as its inability to process multimodal inputs and its slower speed, it is an impressive step toward more human-like AI. For users in need of a general-purpose AI, GPT-4o may remain the better option, but for those who require precision in complex academic or coding tasks, OpenAI o1 is a valuable resource, despite its higher cost and limitations. As OpenAI continues to refine the model, future versions of o1 will likely address these shortcomings, making it an even more indispensable tool for advanced AI applications.

This probe is led by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC), Google’s lead privacy regulator in the EU via a press release on 12 th September, 2024 . Impact on Major Tech Firms : This investigation is part of a broader trend in the EU, where tech giants like Google, Meta, and X (formerly Twitter) are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny over their AI and data management practices. Recently, X agreed to cease using user data from European Union citizens to train its AI systems following court action by the Irish DPC. Potential Implications for AI Development : The outcome of the investigation into Google’s PaLM2 could set a critical precedent for the future of AI development in the EU. It may lead to more stringent regulations regarding how AI models handle personal data and the measures companies must take to protect user privacy. The European Union, renowned for its stringent data privacy laws, has set its sights on Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) model, Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM2). The investigation, initiated by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) , aims to determine if Google has adhered to the requirements set by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , the EU’s primary data protection framework as this scrutiny reflects growing concerns about how AI models, which rely heavily on vast datasets, manage personal information and whether their development processes respect the rights of individuals. Why Is Google Under Investigation? The investigation into Google’s AI model, Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM2), by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) focuses on several key areas related to compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The scrutiny circles around whether Google adhered to the required data protection standards in developing and deploying its AI model. Here are few of the reasons for such investigation: Failure to Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)- A critical element of the investigation is whether Google carried out a legally required Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before processing personal data. Under GDPR, a DPIA is mandatory when data processing activities are likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Protection of Rights and Freedoms of Individuals- The DPC’s inquiry also focuses on whether Google’s data processing activities, particularly in the context of developing PaLM2, adequately protected the rights and freedoms of EU citizens. Given that PaLM2 is a large language model that powers various AI-driven services, such as email summarization and other generative AI functions, its operation relies on processing substantial amounts of data. Role of the Irish Data Protection Commission- As Google’s European headquarters are located in Dublin , the Irish DPC serves as the lead supervisory authority under the GDPR and this means it is responsible for overseeing Google’s compliance with EU data protection laws across the European Union. The DPC’s role includes investigating potential breaches of GDPR, issuing fines, and enforcing corrective measures when companies fail to comply with data protection standards. Dependence on Vast Amounts of Personal Data- PaLM2, like other AI models, requires extensive data to perform its functions effectively and such dependency raises concerns about how the data is collected, processed, and stored. The investigation is examining whether Google’s data processing activities , which are crucial for the operation of PaLM2, align with the GDPR’s principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability. Ensuring Compliance with GDPR Standards- The GDPR sets a high bar for data protection, requiring companies to demonstrate accountability and compliance with its principles. The DPC’s investigation is a reflection of the EU’s broader efforts to ensure that AI models like PaLM2 adhere to these standards. Implications of Potential Non-Compliance- If the investigation finds that Google failed to comply with GDPR requirements, it could lead to significant penalties , including hefty fines and restrictions on data processing activities and the findings could also prompt other regulators in the EU to increase their scrutiny of AI models and their data processing practices. The Broader Context of Regulatory Scrutiny Google is not the only company facing regulatory scrutiny from EU authorities as the probe of PaLM2 is part of a larger trend in Europe, where national regulators are growing concerned with how major tech companies handle user data, particularly in the context of AI research. Earlier this month, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) ordered X (previously Twitter) to stop using user data to train its AI chatbot, Grok, until it could verify GDPR compliance . The Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, similarly was compelled to halt plans to use European users’ content to train its current language model and this decision came after protracted conversations with Irish regulators, illustrating the strain major corporations face to ensure their data methods comply with EU legislation. In 2022, Italy’s data privacy regulator also temporarily banned ChatGPT due to privacy violations , only allowing its return after OpenAI implemented measures to address the regulator’s concerns. Such increasing scrutiny on AI models highlights the EU’s commitment to protecting personal data and ensuring that the rapid advancements in AI technology do not come at the expense of individuals’ rights and freedoms. The Importance of Data Protection Impact Assessments The examination is focused on whether Google did a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), a critical tool for detecting and mitigating data processing risks. A DPIA is required by GDPR where data processing operations are considered to pose a significant risk to people’ rights and freedoms and it requires a thorough examination of how data is gathered, processed, stored, and safeguarded, as well as consideration of potential harm to data subjects. The DPC’s investigation is critical because it could reveal whether Google and other digital behemoths are appropriately assessing the hazards involved with AI-powered data processing as the failure to complete a DPIA could result in harsh penalties, including hefty fines, and may force businesses to change their data-handling procedures to comply with EU regulations. Potential Implications for AI Development The findings of this inquiry may have far-reaching implications for the development of AI systems and if the DPC decides that Google does not comply with GDPR standards, other EU agencies may step up their inspection of AI models and the underlying data processing operations. This, in turn, may result in a more severe regulatory environment for AI development in Europe. The study also has the potential to set a precedent for future AI model development and deployment , underlining the importance of transparency, accountability, and strong data protection measures as companies developing AI technologies may need to invest more in compliance processes, such as performing DPIAs and installing strong data protection controls, to prevent potential dangers. Conclusion The investigation into Google’s PaLM2 AI model by the Irish Data Protection Commission underscores the growing tension between technological innovation and data privacy in the digital age. As AI systems become more integral to daily life, the need for effective regulatory oversight to protect personal data has never been more critical as the outcome of this inquiry could set important precedents for AI development, compelling tech companies to prioritize data protection and transparency in their processes.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "The Deepfake Crisis in South Korean Schools", "url": "https://justai.in/the-deepfake-crisis-in-south-korean-schools/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights: Deepfake Crisis in Schools: A shocking trend in South Korea involves students creating AI-generated explicit images of female classmates and teachers, shared on Telegram chatrooms, with devastating consequences for the victims. Government Crackdown: In response to the rising cases, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has ordered a crackdown on digital sex crimes, focusing on the misuse of AI deepfake technology. Challenges in Prosecution: Despite the crackdown, the prosecution of these crimes remains challenging, particularly when minors are the perpetrators, due to lenient legal consequences for teenagers. In South Korea, the deepfake situation has taken a concerning turn, especially in the educational system where the teenage boys are allegedly obtaining harmless selfies from their female classmates’ social media profiles, utilizing AI technology to produce obscene images, and sharing them in dedicated Telegram chatrooms. These photographs are intended not just to humiliate but also to bother the victims, leaving many of them with psychological trauma. Bang Seo-Yoon, a young activist , has been at the forefront of exposing these crimes as her research uncovers a disturbing pattern where schoolboys, target girls they know, frequently from the same school as their victims, making the humiliation all the more personal and devastating. The victims are left feeling violated, not just by the images themselves but by the fact that these images are circulated among people they see daily. Increased Cyber Violence South Korea, a country famous for its fast internet and technologically savvy population, has long suffered with sexual cyber abuse. However, the introduction of AI and the widespread usage of Telegram have aggravated the situation. The anonymity given by Telegram, combined with the ease with which AI can be utilized to create deepfake content, has resulted in a recent surge in these crimes. According toa report by a cyber security firm Security Hero , the prevalence of deepfake images has increased by 500% globally in 2023, with 99% of the victims being women. South Korea, with its history of digital sex crimes, is now seeing this new form of abuse spread rapidly through its schools and universities. Despite efforts to curb such activities, the problem persists, and the toll on victims is immense. The Government’s Response In light of these alarming developments, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has ordered a nationwide crackdown or restriction on digital sex crimes, with a particular focus on the misuse of AI-generated deepfake technology. The crackdown, set to last for seven months , aims to address the rising tide of such crimes, especially those targeting minors, with the police ordered to pursue criminals ruthlessly. This has however shown out to be easier said than done as the nature of these crimes, which are frequently committed by juveniles , complicates the prosecution procedure. South Korean law is traditionally compassionate toward juveniles, making it difficult to apply harsh penalties even for such serious violations. Legal challenges The challenges in prosecuting deepfake crimes in South Korea are complex on one hand, the use of platforms like Telegram, which are notorious for their lack of cooperation with authorities , makes it difficult to track down and apprehend the culprits and on the other hand, even when the they are identified, the legal system’s leniency towards minors means that many escape with minimal consequences . According to a South Korean Police Report, between 2021 and July 2024, 793 deepfake crimes were reported in South Korea, but only 16 people were arrested and prosecuted . This statistic highlights the difficulties in bringing these criminals to justice and in many cases, victims are left to gather evidence themselves, a process that can be retraumatizing and tiring. Even when cases do make it to court, the penalties handed down are often seen as insufficient, further motivating potential offenders. Victims’ Struggles and the Road Ahead For the victims of these crimes, the impact is devastating as the psychological trauma of seeing one’s image manipulated and shared among peers can be overwhelming. Many victims live in constant fear of where these images might end up next, a fear that is only arising by the lack of serious consequences for the perpetrators. Activists and experts argue that more needs to be done to protect victims and hold offenders accountable and this includes not only strengthening legal penalties but also providing better support for those affected by these crimes. There is moreover a growing call for social media platforms and messaging apps like Telegram to take more responsibility for the content shared on their platforms. Conclusion South Korea’s deepfake dilemma serves as a clear reminder of the hazards that developing technologies represent when misused and while the government’s recent crackdown is a start in the right way, it is evident that much more must be done to safeguard vulnerable people, particularly women and girls, from these pernicious kinds of abuse. The fight against digital sex crimes in South Korea is far from ended, and it will take a coordinated effort from all sectors of society to guarantee justice is served and victims are protected.

In the interview, Mr. Sanyal has also suggested a different approach Complex Adaptive System (CAS) Theory for India to regulate AI. His arguments center around the effectiveness, flexibility, and adaptability of these frameworks in the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI). WHY SANJEEV SANYAL CRITICISES THE APPRAOCH OF EU AND CHINA? Overly rigid and Bureaucratic approach by EU Sanjeev Sanyal believes the European AI Act’s approach is overly rigid and bureaucratic, making it unsuitable for regulating a rapidly evolving technology like AI and his main criticisms include: Static Risk Categorization- The European AI Act categorizes AI systems into predefined risk levels (unacceptable, high, limited, minimal) determined by bureaucrats , which Sanjeev Sanyal finds impractical and counterproductive as he argues that AI technologies are dynamic and constantly evolving, requiring a flexible regulatory approach rather than a fixed categorization that can quickly become outdated. The Act’s rigid framework may over-regulate or under-regulate AI applications, creating barriers that stifle innovation and slow technological growth, ultimately limiting the development of new AI solutions in Compliance Over Innovation- Sanjeev Sanyal critiques the European AI Act for its heavy emphasis on compliance, which he believes may create significant barriers for AI development and such detailed obligations for high-risk AI systems can impose substantial costs , particularly on smaller companies, potentially discouraging them from pursuing innovation. The stringent requirements and regulatory complexity might slow down AI development in Europe , as companies could struggle to navigate these rules, ultimately reducing their capacity to innovate and compete Lack of Adaptability – Sanyal criticizes the Act for its insufficient mechanisms to adapt to unforeseen AI risks as the Act operates on the assumption that AI risks can be anticipated and addressed in advance, which is unrealistic given the inherently unpredictable nature of AI technology. This static approach results in regulatory gaps that fail to account for emerging risks and the Act additionally does not emphasize ongoing monitoring or the need for adaptation to new AI developments, which further limits its effectiveness in managing evolving challenges associated with AI. Limited Impact of Transparency Measures – Despite the Act’s requirements for transparency and user awareness, Sanjeev Sanyal argues that these measures fall short and merely informing users that they are interacting with AI does not adequately address the potential risks involved. There is a need for more comprehensive and practical risk management strategies beyond basic transparency to effectively mitigate the challenges posed by AI technologies. Narrow Focus on Social Scoring – The Act’s prohibition of AI for social scoring is a notable measure, yet it lacks a broader regulatory framework and Sanjeev Sanyal argues that, while banning social scoring represents progress, it does not sufficiently address the full spectrum of AI risks and to be more effective, a more flexible and comprehensive regulatory model is required to tackle a wider array of AI-related State-Controlled Model in China Sanjeev Sanyal criticizes China’s AI regulatory approach, which is heavily state-controlled. The Chinese government aims to exercise complete control over AI and data, which Sanyal argues is prone to significant failures as he references the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan as an example of how state-controlled systems can fail when problems are concealed rather than addressed transparently. The Chinese model, according to Sanjeev Sanyal, may allow dangerous elements to “slip through” due to the tendency to suppress or hide problems rather than tackling them openly and transparently and this lack of transparency and openness could undermine trust and safety in AI applications. Suggestion for India Complex Adaptive System (CAS) Theory In contrast to the EU and China’s approaches, Sanjeev Sanyal advocates for a regulatory framework in India based on Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory . This theory emphasizes flexibility and adaptability in complex environments, and outlines a framework centered around several key principles listed below : Safeguards and Boundaries – Establishing mechanisms to prevent harmful AI behavior, such as “manual overrides” and “authorization choke points,” to maintain human supervision over critical Transparency, Accountability, and Explainability – Ensuring openness in core algorithms, continuous monitoring of AI systems, and incident reporting protocols to document AI failures. Clear Lines of Accountability – Making developers or managers of AI systems accountable for their creations, ensuring they have “skin in the “ Specialized AI Regulator – Proposing the establishment of a specialized AI regulator in India with a broad mandate to oversee AI-related National Algorithm Registry and Repository – Advocating for a national algorithm registry and repository to foster AI innovation in Conclusion Sanjeev Sanyal’s criticism reflects a broader debate over the best approach to be followed to regulate AI, comparing between the EU’s bureaucratic, risk-based framework, China’s state- controlled approach and India’s proposed adaptive, principle-based model. Each framework has different implications for innovation, transparency, accountability, and managing the risks associated with AI development and deployment. Sanjeev Sanyal’s preference for a flexible, adaptive regulatory model underlines the need for a dynamic approach to AI regulation that balances innovation with safety and public trust.

VINOD CHANDRAN", "url": "https://justai.in/why-ai-may-not-be-suitable-for-writing-judgments-insights-from-patna-high-court-chief-justice-k-vinod-chandran/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights: Human Insight is Essential in Judgment Writing : Chief Justice Chandran emphasized that while technology enhances many legal processes, writing judgments requires human interference due to moral reasoning, emotional intelligence, and contextual understanding—areas where AI falls short. AI’s Current Limitations : He expressed skepticism about AI’s potential to write judgments, stating that the time hasn’t yet come for AI to replace human judges in this critical task, as it lacks the nuanced understanding necessary for interpreting the law. The Importance of Human Effort in Legal Work : Highlighting the voluntary work of 1,700 district judiciary officers who translated Supreme Court judgments into regional languages for free, the Chief Justice underscored the value of human dedication and empathy—qualities AI cannot replicate. As the world continues to embrace technology, discussions surrounding the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various sectors, including the legal system, are becoming increasingly common. However, the potential of AI to write judgments has been met with skepticism, most notably by Chief Justice K Vinod Chandran of the Patna High Court. At the launch of six new applications developed by the court’s e-Committee, the Chief Justice voiced his concerns, emphasizing that while digital advancements are crucial for the legal system, AI’s role in crafting judgments remains questionable. The Role of Human Judgment in Legal Decisions Chief Justice Chandran’s remarks highlight a fundamental point: the need for human insight and intuition in the judicial process . He stated, “ Essentially what we have to realize when we go into computerization is that there are certain things where human interference cannot be avoided, like writing judgments .” The Chief Justice acknowledged that while technology has enhanced many aspects of the legal process, judgment writing demands a level of emotional intelligence, moral reasoning, and contextual understanding that AI simply cannot replicate. The application of legal principles often involves a delicate balancing of facts, laws, and societal values—areas where human reasoning remains superior. AI’s Limitations in Judicial Interpretation AI is undeniably capable of processing vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, but when it comes to interpreting the law, nuance is everything. According to Chief Justice Chandran, despite the excitement surrounding AI’s potential in various fields, its use in writing judgments may be premature . “I hear a lot about that all over, but I do not think the time has come yet to speak about what you call AI judgments,” he commented. His words underline the idea that AI, though powerful, is still far from understanding the intricate layers of human society, culture, and ethics required in the legal decision-making process. Recognizing Human Efforts in Legal Translation Chief Justice Chandran’s skepticism toward AI also stems from a deep respect for the human touch in the legal field. He praised the voluntary work of 1,700 district judiciary officers who undertook the translation of Supreme Court judgments into regional languages . He pointed out that while others were paid for similar work, these officers contributed their efforts for free, a reflection of dedication that AI cannot emulate. This example highlights the value of human effort and empathy, essential components of the legal process, which AI lacks. The Human Touch Cannot Be Replaced Judicial decision-making is not just about interpreting the law—it is about understanding the human impact of those decisions. As sophisticated as it may become, AI lacks the empathy and discretion required to make rulings that account for the human condition. As Chief Justice Chandran wisely noted, while technology can assist in many areas of the legal system, it cannot replace the essential human element in writing judgments . His skepticism is a reminder that some things—like justice—require more than just data processing; they require wisdom, compassion, and insight. In conclusion, while AI continues to play a transformative role in various sectors, its application in writing legal judgments remains contentious. The words of Chief Justice K Vinod Chandran serve as a thoughtful reminder that, for now, the complexities of human judgment are beyond the reach of AI.

They include requirements for accountability, risk management, data protection, and maintaining transparency in AI systems. Public Consultation and Potential New Legislation : The proposed AI guardrails (proposed on 5 th September, 2024) are currently open for public consultation until October 4, 2024 as feedback from various stakeholders, including businesses, academics, and the general public, will help shape the final regulatory approach. Following this consultation, the government may introduce a new Australian AI Act or integrate these requirements into existing legislative frameworks. Immediate Actions and Voluntary Compliance for Businesses : While the regulatory framework is still being finalized, businesses are encouraged to proactively align themselves with the Voluntary AI Safety Standard that has already been released and this standard provides a set of best practices for responsible AI use, focusing on data quality, transparency, and accountability, and includes practical guidance on common AI applications, such as chatbots. Australia is moving forward with its initiative to create a safer AI environment by proposing 10 mandatory guardrails for AI systems used in high-risk settings and these proposed rules, launched by Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic on 5 th September 2024 , aiming to minimize risks associated with AI, build public trust in the technology, and provide businesses with regulatory clarity. What Are the Mandatory Guardrails? The 10 guardrails cover a wide range of issues, such as accountability, risk management, data protection, and transparency – Accountability : Organizations will need to implement and publish an accountability process for regulatory compliance, including policies for data management and risk assessment. Risk Management : This involves creating processes to identify and mitigate AI-related risks, considering not just technical risks but also impacts on society, specific communities, and individuals. Data Protection : Organizations must ensure that AI systems protect privacy through robust cybersecurity measures and quality data governance. Testing : AI systems must undergo rigorous testing and continuous monitoring to ensure they perform as expected without causing unintended harm. Human Control : Ensures meaningful human oversight throughout the AI lifecycle, allowing for intervention when necessary. User Information : Requires organizations to clearly inform end-users when they are interacting with AI or when AI is being used to make decisions about them. Challenging AI Decisions : Provides people negatively impacted by AI systems the right to challenge decisions or outcomes. Transparency : Requires organizations to maintain transparency regarding their data, models, and systems. AI Records : Organizations must maintain comprehensive records of their AI systems throughout their lifecycle, including technical documentation. AI Assessments : AI systems will be subject to conformity assessments to ensure adherence to the guardrails. The Road to Legislation The public consultation process for these proposed guardrails is open until October 4, 2024 and this period allows stakeholders, including businesses, academics, and the public, to provide feedback on the regulations. Post-consultation, the Australian government plans to finalize the guardrails and determine the appropriate legislative approach. This may include creating a new Australian AI Act or integrating the guardrails into existing legal frameworks​ as the government’s strategy focuses on preventing catastrophic harm before it occurs, especially in high-risk environments. High-risk AI settings could include scenarios where there are potential adverse impacts on human rights, health, safety, or legal issues such as defamation. Why is the Government Taking This Approach? The Australian government is following the EU’s risk-based regulatory model to strike a balance between the benefits of AI technology and its potential risks. The government’s proposals are aimed at building public trust in AI by ensuring that AI systems are used safely and responsibly in high-risk situations and such framework emphasizes early prevention, accountability, and transparency, while also fostering innovation and development in AI technology. The government also highlighted the gap between businesses’ perceived and actual capabilities in responsibly implementing AI . According to the Responsible AI Index 2024 , while 78% of Australian businesses believe they are using AI safely, only 29% actually meet the required standards and this highlights the need for clear regulatory guidelines to guide businesses towards safe AI practices. Immediate Actions for Businesses To prepare for potential new regulations, businesses are encouraged to align with the Voluntary AI Safety Standard already released by the government and this provides a roadmap for adopting best practices in AI use, ensuring data quality, maintaining transparency, and complying with future legislative requirements. The standard includes practical case studies, such as implementing AI chatbots, to help businesses understand how to meet these new safety expectations. IT and security teams should start working on data quality and security measures, ensure transparency throughout the AI supply chain, and prepare for mandatory conformity assessments that may be required under future legislation​. Conclusion Australia’s proposal to impose required AI guardrails is a big step in the direction of creating a responsible, transparent, and safe AI environment.

Brazil’s Data Protection Authority Action : The ANPD initially suspended Meta’s privacy policy in July due to concerns over personal data usage for AI, but lifted the suspension after Meta agreed to provide clear disclosures to users. Suspension of AI Tools in Brazil : Meta suspended generative AI tools, including WhatsApp’s AI-generated stickers, during talks with the ANPD, and has not confirmed when these tools will be reinstated. Social media giant Meta Platforms has announced on 3 rd September 2024 that it will notify Brazilian users about how their personal data is being used to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) . This move comes after Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) requested more transparency regarding Meta’s data practices. Starting 3 rd September, users will receive notifications via email and through Facebook and Instagram, explaining the use of their data and offering the option to opt-out of AI training. Brazil’s Data Protection Authority Steps In In July 2024 , the ANPD took decisive action by suspending Meta’s privacy policy due to concerns over how personal data was being utilized . The regulator initially halted Meta’s new policy for training AI models with user data, pressing the company to clarify its practices. However, last week of August the suspension was lifted after Meta agreed to inform users about how their information would be handled. Meta Responds to Concerns Meta acknowledged the demand for greater transparency. The company stated that Brazilian users would be fully informed about how their personal data would be applied, allowing them to reject its use in AI training if they choose. “Users will receive notifications via email and in-app, and will be able to refuse the use of their data,” said Meta in its statement. Suspension of Generative AI Tools in Brazil Back in July, Meta also suspended the use of generative AI tools in Brazil, including popular features like AI-generated stickers on WhatsApp. This was particularly important for Brazil, as it is WhatsApp’s second-largest market. Meta explained that the decision to suspend these tools was made in response to ongoing discussions with the ANPD , as it worked to address the authority’s concerns about how generative AI technologies were using personal data. Uncertainty on Resuming AI Tools When questioned about whether Meta would resume these AI tools now that the suspension has been lifted, the company chose not to give a direct answer . Instead, Meta reiterated that the suspension was implemented to address the ANPD’s concerns and emphasized its commitment to complying with Brazil’s data protection regulations. A Step Towards Data Transparency This development highlights the increasing demand for data transparency, especially as AI technologies continue to grow. Meta’s decision to comply with Brazil’s ANPD highlights the global scrutiny on tech companies regarding how they handle personal information . As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, people are more concerned than ever about how their data is being used. In Brazil, Meta is taking an important step toward greater transparency and user control over their data. As the use of artificial intelligence expands, this case sets a precedent for how tech companies may need to adapt their data policies to fit local regulations. In Brazil, the ANPD has made it clear that user privacy and data protection are top priorities . As Meta explores this regulatory landscape, it remains to be seen how this will impact its operations in the country moving forward. Meta’s commitment to informing Brazilians about their data is a vital move towards building trust and transparency, allowing users to make informed decisions about how their personal information is used.

Invasive Technology and Non-Compliance: Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology, which scrapes billions of images from the internet, was found to be highly invasive of people’s privacy. The company also failed to inform individuals about the data collection and did not comply with GDPR data access requests. Clearview’s Controversial Stance : Despite the fines and ongoing violations, Clearview AI continues to operate, challenging the enforceability of the fines and denying its operations within the EU. The AP may hold Clearview’s directors personally liable, emphasizing the global importance of data privacy enforcement. Clearview AI’s GDPR Violations The Netherlands Data Protection Authority (AP) has levied a heavy fine of €30.5 million against U.S.-based facial recognition company Clearview AI. This decision came after the AP found Clearview to seriously violate the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) . Clearview AI built a database containing over 30 billion images scraped from the internet without any consent is at the center of growing global concerns over the misuse of facial recognition technology and the protection of personal privacy. The Invasive Nature of Facial Recognition Clearview AI offers facial recognition services primarily to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, enabling them to identify individuals from photos or video footage. However, the Dutch regulator made it clear that Clearview’s activities are illegal under the GDPR. Specifically, the collection and processing of biometric data —such as unique facial identifiers—without a legal basis constitutes a major breach of privacy laws. Aleid Wolfsen, chairman of the AP, emphasized the invasive nature of such technology, stating, “Facial recognition is a very invasive technology that you can’t just unleash on everyone in the world. If a photo of you is on the internet—and who isn’t? —then you can end up in the Clearview database and be tracked. This is not a doomsday scenario from a scary movie.” Lack of Transparency and Non-Compliance The AP’s investigation uncovered that Clearview not only created its extensive database illegally but also failed to inform individuals that their biometric data was being collected and used. Furthermore, Clearview did not comply with GDPR-mandated data access requests, which allow EU residents to see what personal data companies possess of them and to request deletion of such data. Despite the stern warnings of AP, and the imposition of the substantial fine, Clearview has not ceased its operations in the Netherlands. This has led the regulator to impose additional penalties, potentially raising the total fine to €35.6 million. The AP’s actions are part of a broader effort to ensure that companies operating globally respect European privacy laws, even if they are based outside the EU. Clearview’s Response and the Future of Data Privacy In response to the fine, Clearview’s chief legal officer, Jack Mulcaire, dismissed the AP’s decision as “ unlawful, devoid of due process, and unenforceable,” arguing that the company does not operate within the EU or have any customers there. However, the GDPR’s extraterritorial jurisdiction as mentioned expressly in the act means that any processing of EU citizen’s data, regardless of the company’s location, falls under the scope of GDPR. The situation in the Netherlands is not an isolated case for Clearview AI , as the company has faced similar fines in other European countries. Despite this, Clearview AI continues to operate largely unabated. The AP is now considering holding Clearview’s directors personally liable for ongoing violations, which could have significant implications for the future handling of data privacy by tech companies. The Global Implications of the AP’s Actions As the debate over facial recognition technology intensifies, this case serves as a stark reminder of the ethical challenges and potential risks posed by such tools. The AP’s firm stance on protecting individual privacy and enforcing GDPR principles sets a strong precedent for other regulators worldwide, signaling the importance of upholding data protection in the digital age.

Government and Industry Cooperation: The U.S. AI Safety Institute, operating under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will gain early access to AI models from both companies, allowing for thorough evaluation and feedback to ensure safer AI technologies. Global Implications for AI Governance: This collaboration could influence global AI regulation, encouraging other countries to adopt similar safety assessments for AI models, as seen with recent legislative efforts in California and earlier advisories in India. In a groundbreaking move, leading AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic have agreed to subject their upcoming AI models to rigorous safety testing before releasing them to the public. This collaboration, announced on August 29, 2024, marks the first-time major tech companies have partnered with a government body for such a comprehensive evaluation process, reflecting a significant shift toward ensuring that AI advancements are aligned with public safety and ethical standards. A New Era of AI Safety The agreement was enforced between OpenAI, Anthropic, and the U.S. AI Safety Institute , which operates under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce . This initiative stems from an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in October 2023 , mandating safety assessments for AI models among other critical regulations. The goal is clear: to ensure that AI technologies are not only innovative but also safe and reliable for public use . Access and Collaboration The partnership will provide the U.S. AI Safety Institute with early access to new AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, both before and after their public rollout . This access is crucial for conducting thorough evaluations of the models’ capabilities and potential safety risks. The Institute will work closely with these companies to provide feedback on safety improvements, contributing to the development of safer AI technologies. Elizabeth Kelly, the director of the U.S. AI Safety Institute, emphasized the importance of this collaboration, stating, “Safety is fundamental to enabling breakthrough technological innovation. With these agreements, we look forward to initiating our technical collaborations with Anthropic and OpenAI to advance the science of AI safety.” This collaboration underlines the need for responsible governance in the fast-paced field of artificial intelligence. Industry Leaders Speak Out Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI , expressed his support for the initiative, highlighting the importance of national-level regulations in the AI sector. “We are happy to have reached an agreement with the U.S. AI Safety Institute for pre-release testing of our future models,” Altman said. He added that this move is critical as the U.S. continues to lead the global AI narrative, ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of safety. Similarly, Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic , echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the importance of collaboration with the U.S. AI Safety Institute. He noted that this partnership “leverages their wide expertise to rigorously test our models before widespread deployment,” strengthening the company’s ability to identify and mitigate risks effectively, advancing responsible AI development. Implications for the Future This unprecedented move could pave the way for other countries, including India, to implement similar safety evaluations for AI models before they are released to the public . Earlier this year, the Indian government faced backlash after issuing an advisory that required untested AI models to receive explicit approval before being made available to users, although now rectified the advisory requires such models to inform the users by labeling the possible inherent unreliability of the output generated by such models. This recent development in the U.S. could influence global AI governance, encouraging a more cautious and responsible approach to AI deployment. The collaboration between OpenAI, Anthropic, and the U.S. AI Safety Institute also comes at a time when AI regulations are becoming a focal point in various regions. In California, lawmakers recently passed legislation that would mandate safety tests for AI models exceeding certain costs or computing power . This bill, if approved, could add another layer of oversight for AI companies operating in the state, further highlighting the growing emphasis on AI safety. Conclusion The partnership between OpenAI, Anthropic, and the U.S. AI Safety Institute represents an enormous step toward integrating safety and ethical standards into the AI development process . As these companies share their models for testing and feedback, they are not only advancing the science of AI safety but also helping to restore public trust in AI technologies. This initiative signals a shift in the industry, where innovation is balanced with human oversight and safety, setting a new standard for responsible AI development in the future.

The bill awaits approval from Governor Gavin Newsom now, who has until 30 th September, 2024 to decide its fate. Tech Industry Resistance and Controversies- The AI safety bill has faced significant resistance from major tech companies, including Google, Meta, and OpenAI , who argue that such regulations could stifle innovation and drive AI businesses out of California. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and xAI , and other proponents however argue that the bill is necessary to ensure public safety in the face of rapid AI advancements. Balancing Innovation with Public Safety Concerns- Supporters of the bill emphasize that it seeks to balance innovation with essential safety regulations and such measure aims to establish safety ground rules for AI systems that might otherwise pose threats to critical infrastructure, like power grids or other public utilities, if left unchecked. California Passes Groundbreaking AI Safety Bill California’s legislature recently approved a landmark AI safety bill, known as SB 1047 , designed to regulate and mitigate the risks associated with advanced artificial intelligence models. The bill, which cleared a critical vote on Wednesday , 28 th August, 2024 , requires that AI developers conduct safety testing and publicly disclose their safety protocols. The legislation targets large-scale AI models requiring more than $100 million in data or significant computing power to develop. The bill has sparked intense debate within the tech community and beyond, where the proponents argue that such regulations are essential to prevent potential risks posed by unchecked AI developments, such as AI systems manipulating public infrastructure or creating chemical weapons. Why the Bill is Necessary? The AI safety bill comes at a time when concerns about the misuse of AI are growing and its necessary for the following reasons- Preventing Catastrophic Scenarios – The bill aims to safeguard against potential catastrophic risks like AI systems being manipulated to damage public utilities or critical infrastructure. Establishing a Regulatory Framework – With AI technology rapidly evolving, there is an urgent need for a regulatory framework to keep the technology from becoming uncontrollable or harmful and it offers some of the first ground rules in the U.S. for the responsible development and deployment of AI. Ensuring Public Trust – As AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, maintaining public trust is crucial and this bill is designed to build that trust by setting safety standards and encouraging transparency among AI developers. Tech Industry Resistance and Controversies Despite the bill’s intentions, it has faced significant opposition from several tech giants and industry leaders. Companies such as Google, Meta, and OpenAI have expressed concerns, suggesting that state-level regulations may be too restrictive and could stifle innovation, where they argue that federal-level guidelines would be more appropriate to address the complexities and widespread implications of AI technologies. Martin Casado , a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz , labelled the bill as “ ill-informed,” highlighting the broad bipartisan opposition against it and the critics claim that the legislation is based more on speculative future scenarios than on practical realities. Todd O’Boyle , senior tech policy director for the Chamber of Progress , a left-leaning Silicon Valley industry group, even compared the bill to “ science fiction fantasies.” Supporters Advocate for Balanced Regulation Proponents of the bill, however, maintain that it takes a balanced approach by setting reasonable safety standards without overly burdening AI developers, where the Tesla CEO Elon Musk , who also runs an xAI , voiced support for the legislation, stressing that regulations are essential for any technology that could pose significant risks to the public. Senator Scott Wiener , the bill’s author, pointed out that the measure adopts a “light touch” approach that integrates innovation with safety and emphasized that California, home to many leading AI companies, should lead in establishing responsible AI governance. What’s Next for the Bill? The fate of California’s AI Safety Bill, SB 1047 , is now in the hands of Governor Gavin Newsom. After clearing legislative hurdles, the bill awaits his decision, with a deadline of September 30. Newsom has three choices: sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature. Governor Newsom’s Decision Points Whereas in the past Governor Newsom has voiced concerns about over-regulating AI, he is more interested in finding a balance that will keep people safe without stifling innovation and being the home to leading technology companies, California should weigh economic benefits from creating an AI-friendly environment against potential risks because of unregulated AI development. The Governor is likely to make his decision on the bill since both sides have spoken on it. Tech giants, including Google, Meta, OpenAI , are also against the move since they feel it’s going to drive business away and clamp down on innovation, whereas Elon Musk was vouching for it, saying it could help safeguard mankind from AI misuse while stopping the AI systems from taking over crucial infrastructure. If signed, SB 1047 may place California at the helm in AI governance and may potentially shape federal or other state rulings and this might contribute to adding a proactive reputation for California, especially pertaining to issues linked with artificial intelligence, but there is also a possible backlash by the tech sector since such regulation most likely will be seen as injurious to its growth. Conclusion California’s AI safety bill represents a significant step towards regulating emerging technologies and addressing their potential risks. The measure has sparked controversy and debate, but it also highlights the growing need for a regulatory framework that ensures both public safety and continued innovation in the AI sector. The decision is yet to be made, but its outcome could set a precedent for AI regulation not only in California but across the United States and such decision could determine how the state navigates the complex balance between technological advancement and public safety, shaping the future of AI regulation on a national scale.

It said such risks needed emergent free developments through legislation well in advance so that injurious deepfake content does not proliferate vainly. Inadequacy of Existing Laws to Tackle Deepfake Technology- The court, while hearing the arguments, felt that the existing law, inclusive of but not limited to the Information Technology Act of 2000 and the Digital Data Protection Act of 2023 , does not adequately deal with the heterogeneous complexities associated with deepfake technology. Learning from International Regulatory Practices- According to the court, the comparison is recommended among the regulatory provisions that apply, at least in force in the US as well as the European Union . For instance, certain US states have already introduced legislative proposals that deal with deepfakes used for political manipulation and non-consensual material, while the EU has included the types of AI under its AI Act with tight requirements on transparency and accountability among the operators. Credits: The Print WHY DOES DELHI HC CALL FOR URGENT REGULATION OF AI? The court’s decision to call for legislative action against deepfakes was influenced by several critical factors: Inadequacy of Existing Laws : The court noted that the current legal framework, which includes the Information Technology Act, of 2000, and the Digital Data Protection Act, of 2023 , does not sufficiently address the complexities and threats posed by deepfake technologies​. Existing laws are outdated or lack the scope to fully address the new challenges posed by AI and such regulatory vacuum has created an environment where deepfakes can thrive unchecked, leading to potentially harmful outcomes for individuals and society at large. Global Challenge : Deepfakes are not merely a domestic issue but a global challenge. Countries worldwide are grappling with the ethical, legal, and societal implications of such technologies. The court referred to legislative measures in U.S. states, the European Union, and other regions as examples that India could consider while drafting its laws. Electoral Integrity : With the upcoming assembly elections, the court was particularly concerned about the potential misuse of deepfake technology for political manipulation . Various political parties have already approached the court, highlighting the urgent need for regulatory intervention. Public Trust and Safety : The ability of deepfake technology to create highly realistic but fake videos and images poses a direct threat to public trust in digital content. The court expressed concern over the societal implications, stating, “Everything you are seeing or hearing is fake; it can’t be,” highlighting the necessity to safeguard the public from potential deception. To solidify its argument further, the court suggested studying the legislative frameworks adopted by other countries- United States : Some states in the U.S. have already enacted specific laws to address the issue of deepfakes, particularly focusing on their use in non-consensual pornography, political manipulation, and defamation. For example, California has laws that prohibit the distribution of deepfake content within 60 days of an election and penalize deepfake pornography made without consent. European Union : The EU has initiated a broader approach by incorporating AI and deepfake regulations into its proposed AI Act, aiming to categorize AI systems based on their risk levels and enforce specific requirements to ensure transparency and accountability. Tennessee’s Elvis Act : The court mentioned the Elvis Act from Tennessee , a law that protects the likeness of deceased celebrities from being exploited by deepfake technology without permission, showcasing a niche but relevant example of deepfake legislation. WHY INDIA NEEDS NEW LEGISLATION FOR AI? During the hearing, the Delhi High Court acknowledged that while technology itself is neutral, its misuse poses significant risks and further highlighted the role of counter-technology tools designed to detect and combat fake AI-generated content as a potential solution, stressing on the fact that relying solely on technology is insufficient without proper regulatory oversight . Credits: Deccan Herald Acting chief Justice Manmohan remarked, “You’ll have to do something. You’ll have to start thinking about it; it’s going to be a serious menace in society.” The court also requested the petitioners to submit their suggestions for regulating deepfake technology, taking into account international practices and the evolving nature of AI. WHAT’S NEXT? Moving forward, the court directed the petitioners to study the laws introduced by the European Union, the United States, and other jurisdictions and also asked for a fresh affidavit containing their recommendations on tackling the misuse of deepfake technology. The government is expected to take these suggestions into account while considering the enactment of new legislation . The court set 8 th October 2024 as the next date for hearing the case, signalling its determination to address this issue promptly, and with the judiciary pushing for action, the ball is now in the government’s court to come up with a comprehensive legal framework to regulate deepfakes and protect citizens from their potential harms. CONCLUSION This proactive step on the part of the Delhi High Court might indicate that in India, an emergent need has arisen to take urgent steps for AI and deepfake technologies regulation, and with growing fear of misuse, especially during politically sensitive times, the government needs to get down quickly with framing strong legislation. The best international practices should be followed, and innovative counter-technologies considered continuously to strike a balanced regulatory framework to protect citizens while encouraging technological innovation.

This policy is Due to take effect from 1 st September , 2024 , the policy will be part of a milestone development in relation to how the government has approached governance of AI in Australia. Core Framework: The essence of the new AI policy strategy will be “Enable, Engage, and Evolve” and these are the principles that the government departments need to take into consideration and use AI. Transparency and Accountability: Another key feature of the policy was that it included transparency and accountability in AI usage on the part of government agencies. It required each agency to identify various officials from the hierarchy of the organizational structure who will be responsible for the plan of using AI within their agencies and not to hide any concerns. INTRODUCTION Australia has been leading the world of AI with its various policies and guidelines framework targeted towards responsible use of AI. With Australia’s New “Policy for the Responsible Use of AI in Government”, published by Australia’s Digital Transformation Agency ,it has now stepped up, and is working towards Ethical and Responsible use of AI based technology in government agencies. This policy is due to take effect from 1 st September, 2024. For the purposes of this policy, the Australian Government has adopted the definition of AI provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). According to the OECD, an AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, processes inputs to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. These systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptability after deployment. AIM OF THE POLICY The Policy for the responsible use of AI in Government aims that government plays a leadership role in embracing AI for the benefit of Australians while ensuring its safe, ethical and responsible use, in line with community expectations. The adoption of AI technology and capability varies across different Australian agencies. This policy is designed in such a way that it will provide all the government agencies with standards and baselines hence unifying government’s approach towards transparent and Responsible use of AI. THREE PILLARS OF THE POLICY The newly introduced AI policy is structured around the “Enable, Engage, and Evolve” framework. This approach is designed to provide a comprehensive guide for government agencies on how to integrate AI into their operations, while maintaining public trust and ensuring that the use of AI aligns with the community’s expectations. The first pillar of the framework builds on some of the imperatives of government agencies in the safe application of AI, such as improved productivity, better decision-making, and effective delivery of policy outcomes. Agencies are called upon to establish clear accountability for the adoption and use of AI. Agencies are therefore expected to identify and designate responsible officials, within 90 days from the effective date of the policy , towards demarcating clear chains of responsible parties for the deployment of AI across the public service. The policy’s second pillar in protecting Australians from harm is the responsible use of AI through strategies that aim to mitigate risks with assurance on transparency and explainability in using AI. Each agency will publish, within six months of the effective date of this policy, a Transparency Statement for its adoption and use of AI. Updated on a regular basis, the transparency statement will reflect significant changes in support of open and accountable principles. The third pillar emphasizes that the strides of technological development are quick, and, therefore, AI handling must be agile and flexible. For this, AI applications must be reviewed and assessed continuously so that the government remains responsive to new developments. Feedback mechanisms inlayed into the sinew of governance will enable continuous tweaking in the use of AI, with a view to ensuring that policies and practices remain abreast of rapidly emerging technological innovations. IMPLEMENTATION AND SCOPE OF THE POLICY Starting September 1, 2024 , this policy will apply to all non-corporate Common wealth entities (NCEs), as defined by Australia’s Public Governance, Performance, and Accountability Act 2013 . These entities are required to adhere to the guidelines set forth by this policy. However, the policy includes specific carveouts for national security. It does not apply to the use of AI within the defense portfolio or the ‘national intelligence community’ (NIC) as defined by the Office of National Intelligence Act 2018. The AI policy has been designed to complement and strengthen existing frameworks, legislation, and practices rather than duplicating them. This integrated approach ensures that government agencies not only comply with AI-specific guidelines but also meet their broader obligations under existing laws and frameworks, such as the APS Code of Conduct. PRINCIPLES UNDERLINED IN THE THE POLICY The Australian Government’s AI Policy is underpinned by several key principles aimed at ensuring the responsible and effective use of AI within government operations: Safe Engagement with AI: The policy emphasizes the safe engagement with AI technologies to enhance productivity, improve decision-making, achieve better policy outcomes, and optimize government service delivery for the benefit of all Australians. Accountability and Ownership: Australian Public Service (APS) officers must be able to explain, justify, and take ownership of the advice and decisions made when utilizing AI. This principle ensures that AI-driven decisions are transparent and accountable. Clear Accountability: There must be clear lines of accountability for the adoption and use of AI within government agencies. This principle ensures that responsibilities are well-defined and understood across the APS. Building Long-Term AI Capability: The policy advocates for the development of long-term AI capabilities within government agencies, ensuring that the APS is equipped to effectively manage and utilize AI technologies in the future. CONCLUSION As AI evolves, so too will the government’s policy on it, in a way that keeps Australia at the leading edge of technological innovation but with the highest standards of governance and public trust. This policy marks the first step in a journey that will see AI deployed to make not just many operations more efficient but harnessed to better living qualities for citizens across the board. This structured path, with enablement, responsibilities of engagement, and a continuous evolution, is the shining light now that all the governments of the world could embrace AI with and yet curb its dangers.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "Australia Passed the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill, 2024", "url": "https://justai.in/australia-passed-the-criminal-code-amendment-deepfake-sexual-material-bill-2024/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights of the bill New Offense for Deepfake Material Transmission : Australia’s Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024 was passed by both houses on 21 st August, 2024 . The bill introduces a new criminal offense relating to the use of any “carriage service” to transmit sexually explicit material of another person without their consent and it includes deepfake content created or altered using digital technology specifically, including AI. Severe Punishment to the Criminals : The base offense is awarded six years of imprisonment. It increases to seven years if the criminal was involved in making or editing the deepfake content. Tech-Neutral Drafting : The Bill has been drafted in technology-neutral terms, ensuring its application and relevance in the face of endless development in the world of digital and AI technologies. The Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) bill, 2024 is passed in Australia by both houses as an effort to strongly combat the growing threat of sexually explicit content created using artificial intelligence technology. This legislation is meant to amend the current Criminal Code and seeks amendments that especially relate to and deal with deepfake technology’s use in a malicious way for creating and sharing nonconsensual sexual material . The bill will come into effect after receiving the royal assent. Why the Bill is introduced? Deepfake technology has leaped creativity to an extent where users can create very realistic audio, videos, and images that never existed. This technology holds great potential for creative and entertainment purposes. But, over the time, it has been increasingly used in malicious activities and of course, one of the most concerning use cases is non-consensual Deepfake pornography , which causes huge harm to victims in the form of emotional trauma, reputational damage, and sometimes even blackmail. The introduction of this bill by Australia comes in response to the growing number of cases involving deepfakes which are used to harass, humiliate, and exploit people. FEATURES OF THE BILL Provision for Transmission of Deepfake Material using social media platforms- The bill entails a new offense under Section 474.17A of the Criminal Code Act, which involves the use of a “carriage service” to transmit sexually explicit material of another person without their consent or in a manner that is reckless as to whether or not there be consent from that person. The “carriage service” under the bill is broadly defined to mean any platform that facilitates communication and would thus capture social media networks, email, SMS, and others. An important aspect of this new offense is its inclusion of deepfake material where, it is emphasized that in its absolute form or if it has been altered, wholly created by the use of technology, then it is not outside the scope of the law. It just secures the legislation to include a wide range of manner in which deepfake technology can be used. Provision for non-consensual sharing of deepfake material- The first significant aspect of the offense of transmission of deepfake material is the issue of recklessness and according to the bill, recklessness is defined as that, the offender makes no regard as to whether or not the person shown in material consents its transmission. This definition broadens the scope of the offense to capture not only intentional acts but also situations where individuals act without considering the potential harm done to the person depicted. This is very important in the digital arena, whereby materials are massively diffused at very high speeds, mostly without properly bringing out issues of consent or the effect on the person concerned and by including the stage of recklessness, it is hoped that the law can act to stem the unrestrained sharing of deepfake content. Tech-Neutral Drafting and Future-Proofing of the Law- The outstanding features of the legislation concern the use of tech-neutral language where it neither entrenches nor talks about any particular technology or platform, so it stays relevant even at a time when technology assumes new dimensions. This approach for sure remains very important, considering that innovation in the digital sphere happens at an incredible rate, especially in AI and deepfake technologies, and as because it is tech-neutral, this law will evolve and include the newer forms of digital manipulation once they come into being. Deepfakes are big now, but other technologies might exist in the future that pose similar risks, and this legislation would capture that. Penalties and Enforcement in the Bill- It makes the distribution of non-consensual deepfake material a basic offense and establishes a maximum penalty of six years imprisonment. This expresses the seriousness of the offense, but more importantly, it would hopefully serve as a strong deterrent for prospective offenders. Aggravation in such offenses, w here the offender is directly involved in creating or altering the deep fake material, enhances the penalty to seven years of imprisonment and this makes a distinction, recognizing additional culpability of the person who actively engages in the production of harmful deep fake content. Dealing with the Concerns of Double Jeopardy- The bill also has provisions against double jeopardy whereby one could not be convicted for both the basic offense and the aggravated one for the same act and this helps in ensuring the process of justice remains to be fair though at the same time, offenders are brought to book for their actions accordingly. Conclusion Passing the Criminal Code Amendment Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024 was a landmark moment for Australia in its response to legislative challenges brought about by AI and digital technologies and in respect of this challenge, criminalizing a non-consensual transmission of deepfake material and introducing heavy penalties for such actions elevated Australia to the front line in defending its citizens from digital abuse. While it is a step ahead, the Criminal Code Amendment (Deepfake Sexual Material) Bill 2024 comes as a part of an overall project aimed at renewing Australia’s legal framework in view of the challenges that AI and digital technologies pose. The continuous efforts to update privacy, copyright, and competition law will be required to construct a comprehensive, resilient legal landscape with which to deal effectively with the challenges and opportunities of AI.

While proponents argue it’s essential for public safety, major tech companies and some lawmakers fear it could stifle innovation and drive AI development out of the state. Industry Opposition: Big Tech opposes SB 1047 due to concerns about its potential to hinder innovation, impose legal liabilities, and negatively impact open-source AI projects. Companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic argue that AI regulation should be handled at the federal level for consistency and to avoid a “patchwork” of state laws. Broader Implications: The outcome of SB 1047’s legislative journey could set a precedent for AI regulation in the U.S. and globally. The bill highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing innovation with safety as AI becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of society. Introduction As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the need for robust regulatory frameworks has become increasingly evident. California, home to many leading AI companies, has become a part of this discussion with Senate Bill 1047 (SB 1047) . Introduced by State Senator Scott Wiener , this bill aims to regulate the development and deployment of advanced AI systems in the state. However, the bill has faced significant opposition from major tech companies and some lawmakers. Overview of Senate Bill 1047 SB 1047 is a legislative proposal that seeks to establish safety standards for AI systems developed and deployed in California . The bill targets AI models that cost over $100 million to develop or require significant computing power . Its primary objectives include: Safety Testing: The bill mandates that AI developers conduct safety testing for advanced AI models to ensure they do not pose a risk to public safety. Kill Switch: Developers are required to implement a “kill switch” mechanism, allowing AI systems to be shut down if they exhibit harmful behavior. Third-Party Audits: The bill requires AI companies to hire third-party auditors to assess their safety practices and compliance with the regulations. Whistleblower Protections: Additional protections are provided to whistleblowers who expose AI abuses or safety violations. Attorney General’s Enforcement: The California Attorney General is empowered to sue developers who fail to comply, particularly in cases where AI poses an ongoing threat, such as taking over critical government systems. The Legislative Journey of SB 1047 SB 1047 has already made significant progress in the California legislature. It passed the state Senate with a 32-1 vote and later cleared the state Assembly appropriations committee in the second week of August 2024 . The bill is now set for a vote by the full Assembly , and if it passes, it will proceed to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk for approval or veto by the end of September. While Senator Wiener, who represents San Francisco—home to several leading AI startups like OpenAI—has championed the bill as a necessary measure to protect the public , it has sparked a heated debate among lawmakers. Notably, a group of California Congressional Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, Ro Khanna, and Zoe Lofgren , have expressed their opposition, arguing that the bill may do more harm than good. Why Is Big Tech Opposing SB 1047? Concerns Over Innovation and Competitiveness One of the primary reasons tech companies oppose SB 1047 is the fear that it could stifle innovation . Companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic argue that the stringent requirements could slow down the pace of AI development and make California an unfavorable environment for AI research and deployment. OpenAI’s Chief Strategy Officer, Jason Kwon, emphasized that the bill could drive companies out of California , stating that regulation of AI concerning national security should be managed at the federal level rather than through a “ patchwork of state laws .” This sentiment is shared by other tech leaders who believe that a federal approach would provide more clarity and consistency across the industry. Impact on Open-Source AI Models Another significant concern is the potential impact of SB 1047 on open-source AI models . These models, which rely on freely available code that anyone can use or modify, are considered vital for fostering innovation and ensuring that AI technology remains accessible. However, companies like Meta have warned that the bill’s provisions could expose developers to significant legal liabilities , discouraging them from pursuing open-source projects. Meta’s Chief Scientist, Yann LeCun, has voiced concerns that the bill could harm research efforts, while other technologists argue that the open-source movement is essential for creating safer and more transparent AI applications. Fear of Legal and Financial Liabilities Tech companies are also concerned about the legal and financial risks that SB 1047 might introduce. The bill’s mandate for third-party audits, along with the possibility of civil lawsuits for non-compliance, raises fears about the financial strain it could place on AI developers, especially smaller startups . Opponents argue that these provisions might stifle innovation by fostering an atmosphere of uncertainty and risk. Support for SB 1047: A Different Perspective While SB 1047 has faced significant opposition, it also has its supporters within the technology sector. Prominent figures such as Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI,” and Yoshua Bengio have expressed their support for the bill, highlighting the importance of establishing safety standards to prevent catastrophic outcomes. Senator Wiener has also defended the bill, arguing that it is a “ highly reasonable ” measure that asks large AI labs to do what they have already committed to doing— ensuring the safety of their models . He has made several amendments to the bill to address concerns from the tech industry, including eliminating criminal penalties and raising the threshold for open-source models covered by the bill. The Broader Implications for AI Regulation The debate over SB 1047 is not just about California; it reflects broader concerns about how AI should be regulated in the United States and globally . As AI technology becomes more advanced and integrated into various aspects of society, the need for regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with safety becomes increasingly urgent. While some argue that AI regulation should be handled at the federal level to ensure consistency across the country , others believe that state-level initiatives like SB 1047 are necessary to fill the gaps left by federal inaction. The outcome of this debate could set a precedent for how AI is regulated in the future, both in the U.S. and internationally. Conclusion SB 1047 represents a significant step towards regulating AI in California, but it has also sparked a fierce debate about the potential consequences for innovation, competitiveness, and the open-source movement. As the bill moves closer to a final vote, the tech industry, lawmakers, and the public will continue to grapple with the complex questions surrounding AI regulation. Whether SB 1047 becomes law or not, the discussions it has generated will likely shape the future of AI policy in the U.S. and beyond. As AI technology continues to evolve, finding the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring public safety will remain a critical challenge for policymakers, technologists, and society at large.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "Anthropic faces class-action lawsuit", "url": "https://justai.in/anthropic-faces-class-action-lawsuit/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights Anthropic Faces Legal Action: The Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic has recently been hit with a class-action lawsuit in a California federal court, accusing the company of copyright infringement. Industry Implications: This lawsuit is indicative of a broader trend of legal challenges faced by AI companies, as they struggle with the complexities of using copyrighted content to train machine learning models and such rapid advancement of AI technologies has outpaced existing legal frameworks, leading to a growing number of disputes over intellectual property rights. Potential Impact on AI Development: The outcome of this lawsuit could set a significant precedent for the AI industry, potentially leading to tighter regulations and changes in how AI models are trained and if the court rules in favour of the plaintiffs, it could force AI companies to rethink their training practices, requiring them to obtain proper licenses for the use of copyrighted material or develop alternative methods for training their models. The world of artificial intelligence is being questioned consistently, giving rise to several issues each passing day, as Anthropic , one of the leading AI startups, that has received a boost from Amazon, now finds itself at the centre of a class-action lawsuit filed on 19 th August 2024 . A lawsuit filed in California Federal Court accuses Anthropic of training its AI chatbot, Claude, on copyrighted books without authorization and three established authors who claim that intellectual property has been misused to build a multibillion-dollar business are responsible for bringing in the suit. Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Works The lawsuit was brought forth by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson because it was claimed that Anthropic used pirated copies of their books , among others, to train its AI model Claude and in line with this, the authors claim that licensing for the use of the works had not been sought by Anthropic, thereby infringing on their copyright. The plaintiffs said that due to this practice, Anthropic has held an unfair advantage in the fast-growing AI market, building a business worth billions of dollars , and what makes this case highly significant is that it puts into focus the continuous tug of war between technological advancement and the rights of content creators. Industry-Wide Implications One of many lawsuits flying around against AI companies for the use of copyrighted material, this lawsuit against Anthropic is just the latest case in a long line stretching over the past few years involving tech giants OpenAI and Meta Platforms over similar claims. The lawsuit indicates that creators like authors, musicians, and others are increasingly concerned about their works being used in AI technology developments and as more and more creators push back against the perceived exploitation of their intellectual property , AI companies find themselves in increasingly difficult legal waters. The potential result is the remaking of how AI models are trained, most importantly in regard to proper licensing of content and compensation for creators of same. Impact on AI Development and Copyright Law The Anthropic lawsuit is much more than a simple copyright infringement case as it sits at the crossroads of law, where larger questions about the future of AI development are needed to be answered and if the court decision goes in favour of the plaintiff, it could set a future precedent, forcing AI companies to reconsider their training methods and seek legitimate avenues for making use of copyrighted content. This case might further compel the legislative arm of the government to review the existing copyright frameworks for new regulations , considering the special challenges arising from AI technologies, where clear and fair guidelines for the use of copyrighted materials will increasingly be needed as A.I. technology strengthens and becomes more prevalent in various industries. Anthropic’s Response and Future Outlook Anthropic has so far remained silent over the lawsuit as the company, founded by ex-executives from OpenAI—sibling siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei , has been getting a lot of attention because of its AI chatbot, Claude. However, this legal challenge could be a threat to its reputation and future operations where the lawsuit puts additional pressure on Anthropic and other AI companies to find ways of legitimately using copyrighted content, and in contrast to tech firms , AI companies are more challenged by the complexities pertaining to Intellectual Property Rights. The lawsuit will be closely watched by observers who can see how Anthropic is going to deal with it, as it may possibly affect the broad AI industry at large, where an adverse ruling against Anthropic could open the way for a raft of similar lawsuits, which would further muddy the development and deployment of AI technologies. Conclusion Anthropic’s lawsuit reflects a turning point in the conflict between AI and copyright. As AI technologies go through another dimension of evolution, so must the legal frameworks that govern their development to protect the rights of content creators and it may set a very wide precedent for both the AI industry and the tech community in large . After all, it just might end up deciding how, going forward, AI systems are trained and how creators can protect their intellectual property in the age of digital consumption, but for now, however, all eyes are on the courtroom as this high-level legal battle plays out with billions on the line and implications that just might reshape the future of AI and copyright law.

Trump posts deepfakes : Ex-President of the United States Donald Trump recently tweeted AI artworks on his Truth Social platform and these are of Taylor Swift in “Swifties for Trump” shirts, Kamala Harris at a communist parade that never took place, and Elon Musk. Blurred Lines Between Parody and Disinformation: Trump’s case showed deepfake pictures that hint at the ever-growing challenge of distinguishing between parody and real disinformation, where sometimes AI pictures can be so realistic that the public will mostly find it hard to distinguish between the truth and fiction. As artificial intelligence further inserts itself into the political dialogue, former President Donald Trump’s most recent forays into AI-generated images have coursed with controversy and worry. In such recent sharing of deepfake images featuring Taylor Swift, Kamala Harris, and Elon Musk, Trump did not just push the boundaries of digital manipulation but opened a window onto surging challenges to distinguish between parody and genuine disinformation. The challenge that AI brings to the ability of influencing public opinion, consequently destabilizing democratic processes, becomes all the more acute as the technology evolves. Deepfakes of Swift and Harris The image of Swift shows her and her fans in T-shirts emblazoned with “Swifties for Trump,” but also includes an especially provocative one where she is dressed as Uncle Sam , urging people to vote for Trump. The depictions are not only wrongful but a total fabrication in the sense that Swift has never supported Trump and once criticized him. Beyond the Swift imagery, Trump shared an AI-generated image of Kamala Harris attending a communist military rally as part of the Democratic National Convention . This image, combined with the deepfake video of Trump dancing with Elon Musk —an avowed supporter of his—provided a very clear example of how AI can be used in compiling riveting but misleading narratives and such exploitation of technology triggers many security concerns regarding its possible distortion of public perception and manipulation of voters. AI and disinformation in the election process It means that Trump using AI-generated content has dramatically highlighted a trend that is growing and worrisome in election misinformation. The better the technology, the more sophisticated the AI in creating highly realistic but wholly false content , which creates an environment, where telling the difference between real and fabricated becomes increasingly difficult. Some clear examples were images and videos posted by Trump, obviously showing how AI can be used to spread disinformation and create misleading endorsements or fake scenarios. “Liar’s Dividend” and Media Credibility Donald Trump’s recent activities also illustrate something called “liar’s dividend,” the idea that the proliferation of manipulated content could be what makes people skeptical about all media. When that much fake or misleading information is fabricated, this can cause people to question whether real media is actually authentic and in such a case, Trump is peddling false claims and manipulating images that facilitate, in a more general way, the dismantling of trust in the media, which makes it easier for people to turn away from real content branded as fake. Musk’s Grok and the Evolution of AI Tools The arrival of new AI tools has heaped further attention on AI-generated content. Grok, Elon Musk’s image generator, can cough up everything from the politically charged to controversy-laden images, creating an overload in deepfake material related to the election and that exposes the mega-challenge that lies in regulating AI technology and making sure it is used ethically, as the tool allows the creation of images which other AI models might refuse. The fact that AI-generated imagery flourished immediately following the release of Grok underlines that development and fielding AI must be underpinned by strong safeguards and ethical considerations . Coupled with growing competence and accessibility, tackling potential applications of technologies manipulating the pipeline of truthful information is key to preserving the integrity of public discourse. Historical Background: How AI Changed Political Campaigning The debate raging over AI content is not a discrete one, but rather part of a larger, more inclusive historical setting as years earlier, AI-generated images and videos were already being deployed in political campaigns to influence public opinion. For example, during Ron DeSantis’s quest for the GOP nomination, his campaign posted an image that had been doctored to show Trump embracing Anthony Fauci and a similar charge was hurled at the Republican National Committee over a partially AI-generated attack ad against Joe Biden. These historical examples demonstrate how AI content generation can be strategically applied to focus on political opponents, create misleading narratives, and shape voter perception and given that AI technology will only continue to improve, the potential impact it may have on political campaigns and public trust is of acute concern. Conclusion As AI-generated imagery is increasingly used in political campaigns, awareness and vigilance should be exercised in telling the genuine from the fabricated. Trump’s recent posts thus act as sharp reminders of the many challenges that AI technology will bring forth in maintaining the integrity of public discourse, where in light of the rapid growth in AI, it becomes important to equip oneself with effective strategies in areas of media literacy and regulatory measures against misinformation in order to safeguard democratic procedures and bring about a very transparent and informed electoral environment.

Detailed Classification Systems : It categorizes AI risks using a Causal Taxonomy (why and how risks occur) and Domain Taxonomy (broad domains like misinformation or discrimination), offering a multi-dimensional view of AI challenges. Addressing Framework Gaps : The repository highlights the inconsistencies in current AI risk frameworks, ensuring a more holistic approach to AI risk management by addressing underrepresented risks like environmental impact and information degradation. As AI continues to rapidly integrate into our lives and industries, the potential risks that come with it are growing as well. The recent findings by researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and MIT FutureTech Lab shine a light on these risks and the gaps in current frameworks designed to address them. In response, the team has developed the first-ever comprehensive AI Risk Repository , published on 15 th August 2024 . A Rising Concern: AI’s Rapid Growth and Unseen Risks AI is being adopted across various sectors at a rapid pace. A Census data ( Tracking Firm Use of AI in Real Time: A Snapshot from the Business Trends and Outlook Survey ) reveals a notable increase in AI adoption across US industries, with usage rising by 47%, from 3.7% in September 2023 to 5.45% by February 2024. However, this fast adoption has left many organizations unprepared for the risks associated with AI. As Dr. Neil Thompson, head of the MIT FutureTech Lab , points out, existing AI risk frameworks miss about 30% of the potential risks . These gaps could lead to significant challenges for companies, governments, and individuals alike. What is the AI Risk Repository? The AI Risk Repository is a groundbreaking tool designed to address these gaps. The MIT research team, along with collaborators from the University of Queensland, the Future of Life Institute, KU Leuven, and Harmony Intelligence , created this repository as a living database containing over 700 documented AI risks . These risks are categorized into 7 domains and 23 Sub-domains , making it easier for users to navigate the complex landscape of AI-related challenges. Why the AI Risk Repository Matters The researchers identified critical flaws in how AI risks are currently addressed . According to their findings, most AI risk frameworks focus too heavily on certain risks while ignoring others . For example, 44% of these frameworks address misinformation, but only 12% cover risks related to the pollution of the information ecosystem, which can degrade information quality through AI-generated spam. This inconsistent coverage poses a significant issue, as Dr. Thompson states: “If everyone focuses on one type of risk while overlooking others of similar importance, that’s something we should notice and address.” The AI Risk Repository is a solution to this issue. It provides decision-makers with a comprehensive checklist to evaluate AI risks holistically , helping organizations better prepare for and mitigate AI-related issues. How the AI Risk Repository is Organized The AI Risk Repository consists of three major components that work together to map out the complex landscape of AI risks: AI Risk Database : This database includes over 700 risks extracted from 43 AI risk classification frameworks . It provides detailed information about each risk, including supporting evidence and source information. Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks : This system classifies how, when, and why AI risks occur. For instance, it looks at the entity responsible for the risk (human or AI), the intent behind it (intentional or unintentional), and when the risk happens (pre-deployment or post-deployment). Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks : This taxonomy organizes risks into seven broad domains , such as “Misinformation” and “Discrimination & Toxicity,” and 23 subdomains , including “False or Misleading Information” and “Bias in Decision Making.” These three components offer a way for users to explore AI risks from different perspectives, helping them understand not only what risks exist but also why and how they arise . Addressing the Gaps in AI Risk Frameworks The MIT team found that existing AI risk frameworks are often incomplete. For example, while many frameworks address AI’s potential to perpetuate discrimination, fewer frameworks cover risks related to the degradation of information quality or AI’s environmental impact . This fragmented approach leaves organizations exposed to risks they may not even be aware of. By consolidating these risks into a single repository, MIT’s AI Risk Repository offers a clearer, more complete picture of the challenges posed by AI. The repository is also designed to be updated regularly, ensuring it stays current as new AI risks emerge. Who Can Benefit from the AI Risk Repository? The AI Risk Repository is designed for a wide range of users, including researchers, developers, policymakers, and enterprises . Whether you are building AI systems, regulating them, or simply trying to understand their potential impact, this repository serves as a valuable resource for identifying risks and developing mitigation strategies. In future phases of the project, the MIT team plans to expand the repository to include more detailed insights , such as the likelihood of specific risks and the best ways to address them for different stakeholders. According to Dr. Thompson, “We plan to use this [repository] to identify shortcomings in organizational responses” and to provide “more useful information about which risks experts are most concerned about (and why).” A Living Document for the Future of AI The AI Risk Repository is not a static resource; it’s a living document meant to grow alongside the rapidly evolving AI landscape . As new research is conducted and new risks are identified, the repository will be updated to reflect these changes. Users are encouraged to contribute feedback, suggest new resources, and help refine the database as AI technology continues to develop. This collaborative approach will help ensure that the AI Risk Repository remains a valuable tool for managing the complex risks associated with AI . As Dr. Thompson puts it, “Now [researchers and organizations] have a more comprehensive database, so our repository will hopefully save time and increase oversight.” Final Thoughts: Bringing Clarity to AI Risks As AI continues to evolve and integrate into more aspects of our lives, understanding its risks is more important than ever.

Absence of guardrails in Grok AI : Unlike any other AI image generation, this tool seems to be with very few taboo or control mechanisms in place, where the attempts made by CNN to test the tool showed that the images it generated could easily mislead and even be harmful, hence raising the ethical red flags both on its use and possible manipulation. Criticism of Musk and X : Musk and his platform have drawn criticism for failing to implement enough safeguards to ensure that the AI-generated content cannot be misappropriated or misused in any way and this is in stark contrast to many other platforms and AI tools, which have moved to label or limit the generation of misinformation. Introduction Grok, an Elon Musk AI chatbot, has released this function of creating a picture from a text prompt on Twitter, renamed X, through the release of Grok-2 and Grok-mini on 13 th August, 2024 . Although the creative aspect of this tool received much applause, it attracted a lot of criticism because it created misleading and even harmful imagery of public figures. The real controversy here, though, would be the heightened sense of the broader concern of the ethical usage of AI within media and the role of the tech companies in spreading misinformation. Grok AI: a Two-Edged Sword A whole new section of creativity and expression opened up with the introduction of this feature in Grok creating hyper-realistic images for simple text prompts and this sent an eager audience on X into a lot of highs. However, how this tool can be misused was quite evident with the type of misleading images this section of users started making and sharing on noted political figures like former President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris, or even Elon Musk. The AI-generated images went from the absurd, like Trump participating in the 9/11 attacks , to the benign, such as Musk eating steak while relaxing in a park and at the same time came the realization that creating uncannily realistic images like these, without context or disclaimers, poses a great risk, especially in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. In this way, those images have a very big potential for misleading voters, for example, into creating false narratives that further mislead public opinion. Lack of Safeguards and Ethical Concerns What can be considered most dangerous about the Grok image generation tool is an apparent lack of safeguards to prevent the creation of harmful or misleading content, where the other AI image generating tools of OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and others are equipped with technologies to label or restrict some types of content. Grok, however, seems to give users mostly a free hand in creating images . Tests that CNN ran of the tool focused on how easily it can be used to create fake images of politicians and other public figures, either to be used out of context or with an intention to deceive members of the public and while Grok does have some restrictions —such as not generating nude images and disallowing content that is a clear, explicit promotion of hate speech—it would seem these are inconsistently applied. For instance, the tool was reportedly seen to generate images of political figures combined with hate symbols, thus calling into question the effectiveness of its administered content policies and this has enormous moral implications. The more advanced AI technology grows, the greater the likelihood that it will be used for damaging ends where technology companies like Musk’s xAI bear a moral obligation to see to it that their services are not used to posting false information or to incite violence. The lack of any clear guidelines and the measures to effectively enforce them within the Grok image generation tool strongly point toward the realization of this responsibility not being fully met. Criticism and calls for its Regulation All corners have been on fire with concerns and protests about the new image-generation capability of Grok where protestors against the AI-generated images warned that they spelled great confusion, and even chaos, particularly in political campaigns—an ordeal one would struggle with, to imagine. Such stakeholders as civil society groups, lawmakers, and even some tech leaders further drove their muscles in deprecating the power of AI tools like Grok to generate alarming images of political candidates. Other social media platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, have shifted to tagging AI-generated content shared by users in their feeds, either through detection technology or relying on users to self-identify but nothing of the sort has been done on X, and pressure increases on the site with regards to its supposed commitment to not allowing misinformation to proliferate across the platform. Musk has, in fact, himself been criticized for misinformation posted on X, further blurring lines regarding where X stands with regards to ethical AI use. Conclusion The AI tool by Elon Musk is impressive and full of innovative power, has the potential to transform how people create content and share it over the internet but, it has also brought out immense ethical and regulatory challenges with its emergence, especially regarding the creation of images that mislead and cause harm. We need to be clear about such issues, as technology improves, to ensure that such technologies are used properly and in a manner that preserves the integrity of information and the rights of individuals. The controversy over Grok is indicative of the need for vigilant accountability in this fast-changing landscape of AI and digital media.

Chandrachud unveiled plans for the Supreme Court’s second hackathon, Hackathon 2.0, focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the functioning of the court. This hackathon was announced on 1st August through the Central government’s MyGov platform. The Supreme Court’s AI Vision CJI Chandrachud, during the proceedings of 9 th August, announced that the upcoming hackathon 2.0 will concentrate on using AI to optimize the Registry’s functions within the Supreme Court. Specifically, AI will be employed to address issues such as the removal of defects in petitions and the formatting and sorting of judicial records. This move is part of a broader initiative to transition the court’s administrative processes to an AI-based model, reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to embracing technological advancements. The hackathon, which is being organized in collaboration with the Central Government’s MyGov platform, is a part of the celebrations marking the 75th year of the Supreme Court’s establishment. This event is expected to bring together some of the brightest minds in the country, who will work on developing innovative AI solutions to enhance the court’s efficiency. The objective of the Hackathon One of the key objectives of the hackathon is to leverage AI to improve the functioning of the Supreme Court’s Registry. The Registry is responsible for managing the administrative tasks of the court, including processing petitions, maintaining records, and ensuring that legal documents are formatted correctly. However, these tasks can be time-consuming and prone to human error. By integrating AI into these processes, the Supreme Court aims to automate routine tasks, such as identifying and correcting defects in petitions and organizing judicial records more efficiently. This will not only reduce the workload on court staff but also ensure that cases are processed more quickly and accurately. “This time the hackathon will focus on the use of AI to streamline the functioning of the Registry for things like removal of defects and formatting and sorting of petitions. So we are completely moving to an AI-based model”. ~ CJI DY Chandrachud His call for participation was inclusive, encouraging “all innovative young minds” to contribute, noting that youthfulness isn’t just about age but also about fresh ideas and creativity. What to Expect in the Hackathon? The Supreme Court’s second hackathon is set to be a landmark event, bringing together programmers, AI specialists, and legal professionals to develop AI-driven solutions for the judiciary. The hackathon, commonly referred to as a “codefest”, is a social coding event where participants collaborate to create or improve software programs. This time, the focus will be on building AI tools that can be seamlessly integrated into the court’s daily operations. The hackathon will be open to participants of all ages, with the last date for submissions set for August 31. The assessment of submissions will take place on September 14, and the winners will have the opportunity to see their innovations implemented within the Supreme Court’s Registry. The Significance of AI in the Indian Judiciary The integration of AI into the judiciary is not just about enhancing efficiency; it’s about transforming how justice is delivered in India. AI has the potential to revolutionize the legal system by automating routine tasks, reducing case backlogs, and ensuring that legal processes are more transparent and accessible. This hackathon is a continuation of the Supreme Court’s ongoing efforts to modernize its operations. The first hackathon, which took place last year, laid the foundation for this initiative by introducing AI tools such as SUPACE (Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court’s Efficiency) and SUVAS (Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software). These tools have already made significant contributions to improving legal research and translating judicial documents. With the second hackathon, the Supreme Court is taking a bold step forward, aiming to fully integrate AI into its administrative processes. This move is expected to set a precedent for other courts in India, encouraging the judiciary at all levels to embrace AI and other emerging technologies. Conclusion: The Dawn of a Digital Judiciary The Supreme Court’s announcement of its second AI-focused hackathon marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Indian judiciary. By harnessing the power of AI, the Supreme Court is not only improving its own efficiency but also paving the way for a more modern, accessible, and transparent legal system. As the judiciary continues to adapt to the challenges of the 21st century, the use of AI will likely become increasingly central to its operations. The upcoming hackathon is a clear indication that the Supreme Court is committed to leading this transformation, ensuring that justice is delivered more swiftly and effectively to all citizens. This hackathon is not just an opportunity for tech enthusiasts to showcase their skills; it’s a chance to contribute to the future of justice in India. As the event approaches, all eyes will be on the innovative solutions that emerge, and how they will shape the future of the Indian judiciary.

Illegal use of data for the training of AI: Twitter, now rebranded as “X,” stands accused of training its AI technologies like “Grok” on personal data from more than 60 million EU users without obtaining consent—which is a violation of the GDPR. Mild reaction from Irish DPC : The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) initiated legal proceedings against Twitter to halt the illegal processing of user data, but the DPC has however received widespread criticism in that, as it appears to have focused on mitigation measures rather than really delving into the legality and consent question at the heart of the processing. Introduction: Recently, Twitter AI activities have been put under close observation due to allegations of illegally using personal data from EU residents for training AI technologies such as “Grok” without their informed consent and this has been highly controversial and has led to many lawsuits, especially considering the earlier scandals over those same practices by other technology giants like Meta. It has now escalated into the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) taking court action against Twitter, but their approach is being criticized for not fully enforcing the provisions of the GDPR, whereas meanwhile, privacy advocates from NOYB had to go a step further and send complaints on 12.08.2024, across multiple European countries, questioning the legality and ethics behind Twitter’s practice. AI Data Breach at Twitter The backlash against the practices for the training of AI at Twitter had begun when it emerged that personal data from more than 60 million users across the European Union and European Economic Area were used without explicit consent and it has been fed to the AI systems behind Twitter, including the technology called “Grok,” so it would be able to perform better. Clearly, this is in violation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, under which it is incumbent upon companies to seek explicit, informed consent from users before processing their personal data, not to mention such sensitive purposes of AI training. Limited-Scope of Legal Action The Irish Data Protection Commission — tasked with monitoring Twitter’s activities to ensure compliance with GDPR, since the company’s European headquarters are based in Ireland — responded to the revelations by filing a lawsuit against Twitter and this was quite a departure for the DPC, given how it has historically been less strict on major technology firms. Whereas at a recent hearing, it became crystal clear that the prime focus of DPC was mitigation steps to be taken by Twitter rather than the legality of data processing per se. So, that approach is vastly criticized, showing how the DPC fails to give full support to the GDPR, designed for the protection of the rights of users regarding the protection of privacy and control over their personal data Push for Comprehensive Enforcement In reaction to what it considers weak enforcement by the DPC, the privacy campaign group NOYB, led by well-known privacy campaigner Max Schrems , went a step further. NOYB filed complaints on 12.08.2024, with data protection authorities in nine EU countries—Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain—over Twitter and these complaints call for an investigation by Twitter into its data practice and put pressure on the DPC to enforce GDPR more decisively. The critical issues that arise from the complaints by NOYB are the lack of consent from users and, more generally, how AI systems treat personal data. The GDPR outlines explicit rights of individuals with regard to their personal data, including the right to access, correct, and delete their data but companies like Twitter, however, argue that it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to exercise these rights once data has been used to train AI systems. There is a huge legal and ethical question of accountability and transparency in AI technologies, more so when they rely on large quantities of personal data. Striking a Balance Between Innovation and User Rights Twitter AI cases reflect a more general debate on the balance between the fostering of technological innovation and the protection of the rights of users and while AI certainly holds a lot of potential for applications, the way it has been developed and trained so far gives rise to questions critical to privacy, consent, and control. Art. 82 GDPR provides the appropriate framework with which to deal with such issues; but, the enforcement has so far been patchy at best, particularly vis-à-vis large tech companies with the will and resources to fight against any regulatory decisions, where he complaints further outline the possible processing of special categories of personal data, like data that reveal a person’s ethnicity, political opinions, or religious beliefs, which enjoy even more robust protection under the GDPR. The group thinks that Twitter relying on the “legitimate interest” clause of the GDPR to legitimize its data processing is flawed from the outset. This approach has already been rejected by the European Court of Justice in similar cases involving other tech companies, further underscoring the need for stronger enforcement of laws concerning personal data protection. Conclusion The ongoing, raging legal disputes about Twitter’s AI training practices only underline the increasing tensions between technological progress and the protection of human rights in the digital age. If AI technologies are to further develop, so must their regulatory frameworks and as shown by the case of Twitter, existing data protection laws need to be enforced more effectively, and firms that process vast amounts of personal data need to be held liable and the case outcome has the potential to set a significant precedent for the development and future regulation of artificial intelligence, not in Europe, but around the world as well. Since there were multiple European countries involved in the investigation, this case might enhance and bring stronger coordination to the enforcement of the GDPR across the EU in safeguarding fundamental user rights amidst technologies that are constantly changing.

Psychological and Social Effects: The new AI has human-like conversational skills; human-to-human engagement and social norms which could deeply affect people, where it may even lead to emotional dependence on such AI for a friend. Ethics and Safety Practices: OpenAI harbors safety practices, conducts ongoing research, and has responsible AI development practices to avoid harm. In the entire process, the company struck the balance between innovation and ethical considerations. A recent safety review of GPT-4o by OpenAI came up with a “GPT-4o System Card” report, released on 8 th August 2024 where the voice mode was highlighted and because of the AI’s capacity to express human speech patterns and emotions, the risk stood that users would create emotional bonds with the AI, leading to reductions in human interaction and consequently manipulating social norms. Internal trials confirmed that cases of users getting emotionally attached to the chatbot existed and OpenAI also raised issues with copyright, specifying that GPT-4o can deny requests for copyrighted material, where the company intends to study the impacts further. OpenAI’s recent introduction of a voice mode for ChatGPT marks a substantial milestone in the evolution of artificial intelligence. The feature will give ChatGPT the capability to converse through voice, almost the same as human speech, down to the expression of emotions. While this would work really well in improving the experiences of users through more natural and engaging interactions with the AI, this has also opened the Pandora’s box concerning the psychological and social ramifications of such advancements and in particular, it is increasingly becoming anticipated and viewed with huge concern that users are going to have emotional attachments to the AI, which are going to create unprecedented results in the social and emotional well-being of users. The Rise of AI Emotional Mimicry Notably, OpenAI’s GPT-4o voice mode further revolutionizes AI-human interaction, not just by the natural flow of tone but with human speech emotion and the innovation is working on making it even more life-like, so in the future, it will be almost the same as speaking in person. It increases the engagement for the user, but at the same time, there is a high risk of bonding emotionally with AI, which then gives rise to over-dependence on these bots for companionship and emotional support. The Social Cost of AI Companionship It now touches one of the deepest concerns: that with AI, the decline in human-to-human interactions may only continue . If AI is made so accessible and convenient to use, speak, and understand, people could gradually choose AI over real-life relations and this will have long-term effects on social norms, weakening the fabric of human bonds until it gives way to a society in which AI takes precedence over meaningful human interactions. Balancing Innovation with Responsibility Considering the potential risks, OpenAI has undertaken a series of safety measures and guidelines to ensure the responsible use of the voice mode where the undertaking incorporates continuous research in following up on both the psychological and social effects that interactions between AI and humans might entail, regular update of their system card, and research betterment through user feedback. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical AI development underlines technological innovation with the responsibility to protect users from possible harm, in the sense that advancements in AI should not be at the expense of social and emotional well-being. Conclusion Introduction of voice mode into ChatGPT is an immense revolution in the field of artificial intelligence that can open up newer possibilities of more natural and engaging interactions . At the same time, this brings along considerable risks, especially in the probability of users’ forming emotional attachments to the AI. While society continues to grapple with the complexity involved in AI-human interactions, consideration shall go to the psychological and ethical implications that come with such developments. OpenAI’s commitment to developing responsible AI, through the implementation of safety measures and ongoing research, underlines the message: technological progress must be balanced by ethical responsibility and by taking these matters seriously, OpenAI indeed works on ensuring that the benefits posed by AI are reaped without jeopardizing user well-being.

Several factors would probably limit the development of AI regulations in Chad: among them, low digital infrastructure, low levels of technological adoption, and other pressing socio-economic challenges. Chad, having one of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world, which is a major hindrance to the acceptance and regulation of AI technologies in Chad and with such limited access to the internet and digital devices, the development of AI is not a priority. While the government of Chad does show interest in the realm of digital technologies, it has so far not made any public declarations or published any efforts targeted at AI and any existing digital policy framework for this country would more likely focus on basic ICT infrastructures and education rather than advanced technologies like AI. Chad is a member of numerous regional organizations that have just started discussing AI and digital policy at the continental level, particularly through the African Union and these may feed into Chad’s approach to AI regulation, though this is still in the early stages of discussion. While the specific regulations for AI in Chad may not be as detailed or developed as in some other countries, the existing data protection and cybersecurity laws provide a ground for tackling AI-related issues. It includes- Data Protection: Most AI systems process significant amounts of personal data. Chad’s laws on the protection of data subjects—principally Decree No. 75 and Law No. 008/PR/2015 secure the fact that AI systems respect regulations on data collection, storage, and usage. Cybersecurity: This entails the cybersecurity provisions under Law No. 009/PR/2015 and their updating by Order No. 008/PCMT/2022 , which would ensure protection against threats an AI system could be exposed to, including data breaches and cyber-attacks. National Agency’s Role: The National Agency for Computer Security and Electronic Certification shall be in charge of executing the laws on data protection and cybersecurity, which will indirectly impact the deployment and regulation of AI technologies and it is the preview of this agency that deals with the check to ensure an AI system fulfils all the conditions of the above-stated regulations. Complying with Regional Standards: Chad, by adhering to the Malabo Convention , continues to show commitment to the regional standards in data protection and cybersecurity, which will shape how the governance of artificial intelligence systems will be in terms of regional compliance requirements. Chad may begin to adopt components of these strategies or work with peers in neighbouring countries to come up with a more homogeneous approach toward the regulation of AI, as strategies on the continent are unfolded by the African Union and other regional bodies and to be able to effectively regulate or even widely implement AI in Chad, the country would have to invest in improving its digital infrastructure and increasing digital literacy among its populace. This will be a slow process, although it may very well be a necessary precursor to any meaningful AI regulation.

Many countries across Africa are on the road to developing their own AI strategies, where the African Union is working on a continental AI strategy that nearly every African nation, including Libya, is likely to subsequently adopt. To attain such harmony, AI has to be developed in such a way as to accord with ethics and pay dividends to socio-economic growth on the continent. The general approach regarding the regulation of AI for Africa is influenced by the international models, into which the European Union AI Act currently falls but, the adoption and adaption of each country into these regulations would vary based on its necessity and capability​. AI regulation in Libya remains fragmentary and slow, as the country is battling continuous political instability and governance challenges and unlike some African countries which have either developed or began to speak about formal AI policies or frameworks, Libya does not have yet an overall relevant AI regulatory framework. In the year 2023, Libya showed greater interest in AI, especially through the Ministry of Economy and Trade in Tripoli and the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Committee in August 2023 was a pragmatic step in considering the potential of AI in terms of improving economic and institutional performance. Provisions, however, are still under discussion on how to use the mechanisms of this study to employ artificial intelligence in various fields. The development of AI regulation and data protection in Libya are closely correlated, both being in their cradle and reflecting the broader challenges in establishing robust governance frameworks within the country. AI is a relatively recent area of interest that Libya has started exploring, especially through the efforts of the Ministry of Economy and Trade through talks held back in 2023 and the talks are focused on how Artificial Intelligence can eventually improve the performance economically and institutionally, but no comprehensive regulating framework for AI exists to this day. In the same breath, data protection laws in Libya are underdeveloped and probably the most important steps in this sphere are the laws of cybercrime and electronic transactions, in 2022, that cover a few parts of data protection, but far from a comprehensive legal framework. A common shortcoming in both areas is the lack of a focused regulatory authority where the National Authority for Information Security and Safety helps to wield some oversight, especially in as far as data protection is concerned, but its scope is limited, especially in the private sector. Discussions on AI are not yet translated into laws or establishing a regulating entity and this lack of specific oversight is a part of broader challenges for Libya in modernizing its legal systems, particularly in fast-evolving fields of technology and data governance. It is only of late that the country seems to be in the process of addressing the defects in anything over data protection and privacy matters by way of legislation. As such, in 2022, Libya developed two laws: Law No. 5/2022 on Combating Cybercrime and Law No. 6/2022 on Electronic Transactions which represent a real step toward enabling a suitable legislative framework for data protection, but they are still deficient in covering all related issues to data privacy in the contemporary world. The 2011 Libyan Constitution contains provisions on privacy, but its tilt seems more in securing secrecy to communications than in comprehensive data protection. The National Information Security and Safety Authority is responsible for protecting information, particularly in the public sector but It does not have obligatory policies on the private sector. However, with this effort, there lacks a solid authority to protect data or even legal definitions and protections like those in other jurisdictions with the likes of GDPR in Europe.

Still, similar to other nations, Algeria is just beginning to realize the importance of Artificial Intelligence in various sectors including industries, health, and governance. As the focus in Algeria has been on transitioning into a digital and technological era, such a focus may eventually be concentrated on more specific regulations related to AI. Algeria is invested through a Data Protection Law , or specifically, by Law No. 18-07, 2018 , which governs the collection, processing, and storage of personal data—probably not AI-specific but potentially has an impact for AI applications, particularly those with personal data. It is aimed at governing the protection of personal data, marking a wide step toward compliance with global standards of data protection, since it lays down rules comprehensively regarding how personal data is supposed to be collected, processed, stored, and shared, making sure that respect is given to the right to privacy of the individual. The provisions provide substance to the identity of an entity or organization that is dealing with personal information, focusing on the necessity for explicit consent from people whose personal information is being processed. The African Union, as an organization, has been on the forefront of advancing digital transformation with the adoption of the Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa 2020-2030 and the realization of the African Continental Free Trade Area, AfCFTA . These initiatives are in an effort to have an all-inclusive single African digital arena that will spearhead economic growth, create jobs, and improve the quality of life of the African people. The DTS 2020-2030 is centered on a completely integrated, inclusive digital society and economy for Africa, driven by digital technologies, which can be utilized to enhance the lives of citizens and reinforce the continent’s positioning in the global economy. Such a vision is inclined and articulated on how to realize a secure Digital Single Market by the year 2030, which harmonizes policies, regulations, and investment environments across Africa where this is achieved through an empowered citizenry that has acquired digital skills to ensure broad participation in the digital economy. Another very critical aspect of the DTS, therefore, is the strengthening of cybersecurity and data protection measures for digital ecosystems and individual privacy and rather, it is based on digital sovereignty, whereby Africa is to have full control over its digital infrastructure and data. As a consequence of this approach, a great deal of opportunities for scaling tech start-ups and e-businesses will be created within one single, interconnected market. The AI Data Policy Framework 2022 complements this DTS by focusing on using the transformative potential that lies within data to benefit African nations, considering that the main interest is directed at creating a trusted, secure, and harmonized data governance system across the continent. Another key element is the promotion of free cross-border data flows, thereby ensuring the movement of data moves without any obstacle within Africa, while at the same time being protected with robust safeguards against privacy violations and national security risks. The policy also aims to see that the gains from using the data are equitably distributed in different regions and populations in Africa and in furtherance of this, the framework promotes strong institutions for governance of overseeing data management in such a way that responsible and innovative use is combined with due respect for human rights.

The Court stresses that submissions should be based on accurate, trustworthy sources to avoid errors in legal arguments. Human Oversight : The Court emphasizes that despite AI’s capabilities, lawyers remain fully responsible for the accuracy of their work. They must review and verify all AI-generated content to ensure it aligns with reliable information and upholds the justice system’s standards. No AI Disclosure Required : Reflecting a broader trend in Canadian courts, the guidance does not require lawyers to disclose their use of AI in legal documents, focusing instead on maintaining ethical and deontological obligations, including citing reliable sources and verifying submissions. The Quebec Court of Appeal released new guidance on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in legal proceedings on 8 th August 2024 , marking an important development in how technology is integrated into the legal profession. As AI continues to evolve and become more prevalent in various sectors, the Court’s guidance emphasizes the importance of caution, reliability, and human involvement when leveraging AI tools in legal work. Caution: A Necessary Approach The Court’s guidance begins by urging litigants to exercise caution when relying on AI for legal research and document preparation . AI is undoubtedly a powerful tool, capable of streamlining legal processes and providing quick access to vast amounts of information. However, it is not infallible. The Court stresses that when using AI, particularly in the context of preparing written or oral submissions, lawyers must be vigilant and critical of the information generated. “The Court of Appeal urges litigants to exercise caution when relying on legal sources or analyses obtained or prepared with the help of artificial intelligence for use in their written or oral submissions, ” the guidance notes. This reminder is crucial, as AI-generated content can sometimes be inaccurate or misleading, leading to potential errors in legal arguments . Reliability: Ensuring Trustworthy Sources A key component of the Court’s guidance is the emphasis on reliability. To alleviate the risk of AI producing fabricated or incorrect legal sources , the Court advises that submissions should be based on authoritative texts, case law, and doctrine from reputable sources . The guidance specifically references the Chief Justice’s Directive on the preparation of legal documents, which mandates that lists of authorities include hyperlinks to recognized websites accessible free of charge. This requirement initially introduced for convenience and environmental considerations , now plays an important role in ensuring the integrity of legal submissions . By linking directly to trusted sources, the likelihood of presenting erroneous or “hallucinated” cases—where the AI creates a case that does not exist—is significantly reduced. Human Involvement: The Final Check Despite the advancements in AI technology, the Quebec Court of Appeal makes it clear that human involvement remains essential . Lawyers are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of their work , whether AI-assisted or not. The guidance emphasizes that litigants must thoroughly review and confirm the information provided by AI, ensuring that it aligns with reliable databases and maintains the standards of the justice system. “It is their responsibility to perform the necessary cross-checks with reliable databases to ensure that references and their content stand up to thorough scrutiny and maintain the integrity and reliability of our justice system,” the guidance asserts. This reinforces the idea that while AI can assist in legal research and drafting, it cannot replace the critical judgment and expertise of a trained legal professional. The Decline of AI Disclosure Requirements Interestingly, the Court’s guidance does not require lawyers to disclose their use of AI in preparing legal documents. This approach reflects a broader trend in Canadian courts, where the focus has shifted away from mandating disclosure and towards ensuring that ethical and deontological obligations are met . Lawyers are already expected to cite only reliable sources and verify their work, regardless of whether AI is involved. Embracing AI with Responsibility The Quebec Court of Appeal’s guidance on AI usage marks a progressive step in integrating technology into the legal field while maintaining the high standards of accuracy and reliability required in the justice system. As AI continues to develop, legal professionals must embrace these tools with caution, ensuring that human oversight remains at the forefront. By adhering to the principles outlined by the Court—caution, reliability, and human involvement—lawyers can leverage AI effectively while upholding the integrity of their work. This guidance serves as a reminder that while AI can be a valuable asset in the legal profession, it is not a substitute for the expertise and judgment that lawyers bring to the table. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, the responsible use of AI will be key to ensuring that justice is served accurately and fairly.

Debate on Compute Power as a Risk Measure : While Compute Power is currently used as a proxy to assess AI risks, there is ongoing debate about its adequacy. The consultation seeks views on alternative risk thresholds, such as those based on AI capabilities, societal impact, or ethical considerations. Strategic Implementation of Risk Thresholds : The OECD is exploring strategies for setting and enforcing AI risk thresholds. Stakeholders are encouraged to share their thoughts on effective approaches for measuring real-world AI systems and imposing requirements on systems that exceed established thresholds. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is taking a momentous step in addressing the potential risks associated with advanced AI systems. In collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, the OECD has launched a public consultation aimed at exploring approaches, opportunities, and limitations for establishing risk thresholds for these sophisticated technologies on 26 th July 2024 . This initiative reflects a growing global concern about how to effectively govern AI systems that are becoming increasingly integral to our lives, yet pose complex challenges due to their rapid evolution and potential for significant impact. The Need for AI Risk Thresholds As AI systems continue to advance, there is a pressing need to ensure that these technologies are developed and deployed responsibly. Risk thresholds are a key tool in this effort . According to the OECD, “risk thresholds refer to the values establishing concrete decision points and operational limits that trigger a response, action, or escalation.” These thresholds can be based on various factors, including technical aspects like error rates or computational power, as well as human values such as social or legal norms . The ultimate goal is to identify when AI systems present unacceptable risks or require enhanced scrutiny and mitigation measures. In recent years, the concept of setting risk thresholds has gained traction within both policy and technical communities. For instance, the May 2024 AI Seoul Summit saw 27 countries and 16 AI companies commit to setting risk thresholds, evaluation criteria, and mitigation approaches . Additionally, voluntary commitments by leading AI companies in the United States have emphasized public reporting on system capabilities and discussions of societal risks —steps that could be instrumental in establishing effective risk thresholds. The Debate Over Compute Power as a Measure of Risk One of the central questions in this public consultation is whether AI risk thresholds based on Compute Power are sufficient to mitigate risks from advanced AI systems. Compute Power, often measured in FLOPS (floating-point operations per second), has been used as a proxy for AI system capabilities . For example, the European Union AI Act and the US Executive Order on AI have introduced reporting and oversight requirements for models that exceed certain compute thresholds. However, there is an ongoing debate about the adequacy of Compute Power as a sole measure of risk . Some experts argue that these thresholds can be somewhat arbitrary and may lead to unintended consequences . As the OECD notes, “the text of some policy documents suggests that such thresholds may serve as temporary proxy measures for AI system capabilities until more specific capability-oriented thresholds can be identified and measured.” Exploring Alternative Risk Thresholds Beyond Compute Power, the OECD is also interested in exploring other types of AI risk thresholds that could be valuable in managing advanced AI systems . These might include thresholds based on specific AI capabilities, societal impact, or ethical considerations. The consultation seeks input on what these alternative thresholds could be and how they might be effectively implemented . One of the key challenges in establishing these thresholds is the dynamic nature of AI technology . As AI systems evolve, so too must the criteria used to assess their risks. This raises important questions about how governments and companies can stay ahead of these developments and ensure that their risk management strategies remain relevant. Strategies for Setting and Implementing AI Risk Thresholds Identifying and setting appropriate AI risk thresholds is only the first step. Measuring real-world systems against these thresholds and determining the appropriate response when thresholds are exceeded is equally crucial. The OECD consultation invites suggestions on the strategies and approaches that could be used to achieve this. For systems that exceed established thresholds, there may be a need for specific requirements, such as increased oversight, transparency, or even limitations on deployment . The consultation is an opportunity for stakeholders to share their views on what these requirements should be and how they can be enforced. The Path Forward: Considerations for the OECD and Collaborating Organizations As the OECD and its partners work towards designing and implementing AI risk thresholds, they must consider a wide range of factors. This includes not only the technical and ethical aspects of AI risk management but also the broader societal implications. The consultation emphasizes that while voluntary commitments by companies are a positive step, they may not be sufficient on their own to prevent potential negative impacts. To ensure a comprehensive approach, the OECD is seeking input from a diverse array of stakeholders. The results of this consultation will inform further research and analysis, helping to shape future policies and strategies for managing the risks associated with advanced AI systems. Conclusion The OECD’s public consultation on AI risk thresholds represents a critical opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the discussion on how to best manage the risks posed by advanced AI systems. Whether you are an AI expert, a policymaker, or simply someone with a keen interest in the future of AI, your input can help shape the policies that will govern these powerful technologies. The deadline to participate is 10 September 2024 , so don’t miss the chance to have your voice heard in this important conversation.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "GOOGLE’S RECOMMENDATION TO REGULATE AI", "url": "https://justai.in/googles-recommendation-to-regulate-ai/", "raw_text": "Introduction The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about transformative changes across various sectors, promising significant benefits for economies and societies. However, with these advancements come critical challenges that necessitate effective regulation. Google’s “Recommendations for Regulating AI,” outlines a comprehensive framework for regulating AI technologies that balances innovation with safety and accountability. This blog delves into the key recommendations presented in the document, emphasizing the importance of a tailored regulatory approach to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating associated risks. Background Google has been a pioneer in AI development, recognizing its potential to enhance performance across diverse domains such as healthcare, transportation, and energy. The company emphasizes that while self-regulation is essential, it is insufficient on its own. As Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, states, “AI is too important not to regulate”. The challenge lies in establishing a regulatory framework that is proportionate and tailored to the unique risks associated with different AI applications, ensuring that innovation is not stifled. Key Recommendations for Regulating AI General Approach Sectoral Approach : Regulation should focus on specific applications of AI rather than attempting a broad, one-size-fits-all model. Each sector—be it healthcare, finance, or transportation—has unique regulatory needs based on its operational context and risk profile. For instance, health agencies are best positioned to evaluate AI’s use in medical devices, while energy regulators can assess AI applications in energy production and distribution. Leveraging existing regulatory frameworks will facilitate a more effective and context-sensitive approach to AI regulation. Proportionate, Risk-Based Framework: A risk-based approach is crucial for regulation, targeting high-risk use cases while acknowledging the potential benefits of AI. The framework regulating AI should consider both the likelihood of harm and the opportunity costs of not utilizing AI. For example, if an AI system can perform a life-saving task more effectively than existing methods, regulatory frameworks should not discourage its use due to perceived risks. Interoperable Standards: Given the global nature of AI technologies, regulatory frameworks should promote interoperability across jurisdictions. Internationally recognized standards can serve as a foundation for self-regulation and guide regulatory practices. Google encourages policymakers to engage with organizations like the OECD and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) to foster global alignment on AI governance. Parity in Expectations: AI systems should be held to similar standards as non-AI systems unless there are clear justifications for differing expectations. This principle aims to prevent unnecessary barriers to AI adoption. For example, if an AI system can perform a task with comparable accuracy to a human, it should not face stricter scrutiny solely because it is AI-driven. Transparency as a Means to an End : Transparency should be designed to enhance accountability and trust rather than serve as an end goal. Requirements should be tailored to the needs of different stakeholders, ensuring that information is actionable and comprehensible. For instance, while detailed information about individual decisions may be necessary in some contexts, general insights into how AI systems operate may suffice in others. Implementation Practicalities Clarifying Risk Assessment Expectations : Organizations should conduct thorough risk assessments prior to launching AI applications. Regulatory guidance is needed to establish appropriate thresholds for risk classification, ensuring that organizations understand when a product should be considered high-risk. Pragmatic Disclosure Standards : Setting realistic disclosure standards can facilitate compliance without overwhelming organizations. Requirements should focus on essential information that enhances understanding and accountability. Compromise on Explainability and Reproducibility: Achieving workable standards for explainability may require flexibility. While transparency is important, it should not become a barrier to innovation. Ex-Ante Auditing Focused on Processes: Auditing should center on the processes involved in AI development and deployment rather than solely on outcomes. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of potential risks. Fairness Benchmarks: Establishing fairness benchmarks is crucial, but they should be pragmatic and reflect the complexities of real-world applications. Regulators should consider the context in which AI is deployed to ensure fairness without imposing unrealistic standards. Robustness with Contextual Tailoring: While robustness is essential, expectations should be tailored to the specific context in which AI is used. This approach recognizes that not all AI applications carry the same level of risk. Caution Against Over-Reliance on Human Oversight: Human oversight should complement, not replace, robust AI governance. Relying solely on human intervention can lead to complacency and overlook systemic issues within AI systems. Conclusion The recommendations outlined in Google’s document provide a comprehensive framework for regulating AI that balances the need for innovation with the imperative of safety and accountability. By adopting a sectoral, risk-based approach, promoting interoperability, and ensuring transparency, stakeholders can work together to harness the full potential of AI for societal benefit. As we navigate the complexities of AI governance, it is crucial for policymakers, industry leaders, and civil society to engage in ongoing dialogue to establish effective regulatory practices that foster responsible AI development. By sharing insights and best practices, we can create a regulatory environment that not only protects individuals and communities but also encourages innovation and growth within the AI sector.", "summary": "Authored by Ms. Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2024-08-07T17:03:58", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:48.344442", "tags": [90, 91, 107, 173, 172, 175, 176, 174], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "GOOGLE’S RECOMMENDATION TO REGULATE AI – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/googles-recommendation-to-regulate-ai/"}}

The court held that using Singh’s voice, name, and likeness without permission for commercial purposes violates his rights and can threaten his livelihood. Unauthorized AI Exploitation : The case highlights the unauthorized use of AI to mimic Singh’s voice and persona, leading to potential commercial and personal harm. The court emphasized that such AI-generated content without consent infringes on a celebrity’s right to control their own identity and can lead to economic damage. Scope of Protection : Singh sought legal protection against the unauthorized commercial use of his name, voice, and likeness, including unauthorized event promotions and merchandise. The court’s decision underscores the importance of safeguarding a celebrity’s persona from exploitation by AI and other means. Bombay High Court Ruling in Favor of Arijit Singh ‘This form of technological exploitation not only infringes upon the individual’s right to control and protect their likeness and voice but also undermines their ability to prevent commercial and deceptive uses of their identity,’ the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Arijit Singh . Interim Relief Granted The Bombay High Court has granted interim relief to singer Arijit Singh on 26 th July 2024, in his copyright suit ( Arijit Singh v. Codible Ventures LLP, Interim Application (L) No. 23460 of 2024 ) against artificial intelligence (AI) platforms and others for violating his personality rights. Justice Riyaz Iqbal Chagla noted that Singh’s name, voice, image, likeness, persona, and other traits are protectable under his personality rights and right to publicity . The Court stated that using a celebrity’s voice without permission violates their personality rights. Technological Exploitation and Its Impact “This form of technological exploitation not only infringes upon the individual’s right to control and protect their own likeness and voice but also undermines their ability to prevent commercial and deceptive uses of their identity,” Bar and Bench quoted the court ruling. The Bombay High Court highlighted performers’ vulnerability to AI content targeting, threatening their livelihood. The defendants attract visitors to their sites and AI platforms by exploiting the plaintiff’s fame, risking the plaintiff’s personality rights, the ruling said. AI encourages users to create fake recordings and videos misusing the plaintiff’s identity. The Court added that allowing this use without consent risks severe economic harm to the plaintiff’s career and opens opportunities for misuse by malicious individuals. Scope of Protection Sought by Arijit Singh Arijit Singh sought court protection for his name, voice, signature, photograph, image, caricature, likeness, and other personality traits . This action followed his discovery that AI platforms mimicked his personality through sophisticated algorithms. One platform even used text-to-speech software to convert text into his voice. Unauthorized Use Beyond AI Platforms – Use in Events and Merchandise The Bollywood singer’s traits were unauthorizedly used beyond AI platforms. A pub in Bangalore promoted an event using his name and image without permission . Another party used his photographs on merchandise sold online , and one more registered domain names using his name . Legal Arguments and Court’s Decision Singh has exclusive control over his personality traits , and the defendants should be stopped from using these traits commercially without permission to protect his reputation, the singer’s lawyer argued. The lawyer also claimed that unauthorized changes or sharing of Singh’s performances, which could harm his reputation , would violate his moral rights under Section 38-B of the Copyright Act, 1957 . The Bombay High Court has granted interim relief to singer Arijit Singh. Legal Background and Analysis Personality and Publicity Rights Singh was seeking protection of his personality rights viz. his name, voice, signatures, photograph, image, caricature, likeness, persona, and various other attributes of his personality against unauthorized/unlicensed commercial exploitation, and misuse of all hues thereof. The present suit also pertained to the violation of his moral rights in his performances conferred upon him by Section 38-B of the Copyright Act, 1957 (‘1957 Act’). Judicial Opinion A Single Judge Bench of R.I. Chagla, J., opined that the creation of new audio or video content/songs/videos in Singh’s AI name/voice, photograph, image, likeness, and persona without his consent and commercially using the same could potentially jeopardize plaintiff’s career/livelihood. The Court held that Singh made a strong case for the grant of ad-interim injunction, which might also operate as a dynamic injunction and thus, restrained Defendants from violating the personality rights and/or publicity rights of the Plaintiff by using his (i) name “Arijit Singh”, (ii) voice/vocal style and technique/vocal arrangements and interpretations, (iii) mannerism/manner of singing, (iv) photograph, image or its likeness, (v) signature, persona, and/or any other attributes of his personality in any form, for any commercial and/or personal gain and/or otherwise by exploiting them in any manner whatsoever, without plaintiff’s consent and/or authorization. The Court relied on Karan Johar v. Indian Pride Advisory Pvt. Ltd., Order dated 13-06-2024 in Interim Application (L) No.17865 of 2024 in Commercial IPR Suit (L) No.17863 of 2024, wherein it was held that personality/publicity rights were vested in celebrities and the unauthorized use of the name or other persona attributes of celebrities would amount to violation of their valuable personality rights and right to publicity. The Court also relied on Anil Kapoor v. Simply Life India, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 6914 and opined that plaintiff’s personality traits and/or parts thereof, including his name, voice, photograph/caricature, image, likeness, persona, and other attributes of his personality were protectable elements of his personality rights and right to publicity. Unauthorized Exploitation The Court noted that Defendants were unauthorizedly using Singh’s personality traits such as name, image, likeness, etc. and it also appeared that such illegal exploitation of Singh’s personality rights and right to publicity by Defendants was for commercial and personal gain. The Court opined that making AI tools available that enable the conversion of any voice into that of a celebrity without his/her permission constituted a violation of the celebrity’s personality rights. Such tools facilitate unauthorized appropriation and manipulation of a celebrity’s voice, which was a key component of their personal identity and public persona. Conclusion The Bombay High Court’s decision in Arijit Singh’s case marks a noteworthy step in the legal protection of personality rights amid the rising influence of artificial intelligence. By addressing the unauthorized use of AI to replicate a celebrity’s voice and persona, the court has set a precedent for safeguarding individual identity against technological exploitation . As AI tools continue to evolve, this ruling emphasizes the need for such legal frameworks that ensure that personal likeness and creative assets are not misappropriated for commercial gain. Singh’s victory not only affirms the protection of personal rights but also highlights the broader implications for all public figures navigating the complexities of modern digital landscapes.

Musk claims he was deceived into co-founding OpenAI under false pretext. Partnership with Microsoft and Breach of Principles : The lawsuit contends that OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft, which brought significant funding and resources, breached the company’s founding principles. Musk argues this collaboration shifted OpenAI’s focus from developing AI for humanity’s benefit to pursuing profit-driven goals. Federal Racketeering Allegation and AGI Debate: Musk’s new lawsuit includes a serious allegation of federal racketeering, claiming a conspiracy to defraud him. It also questions the terms of OpenAI’s contract with Microsoft concerning the achievement of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), adding complexity to the ongoing dispute over the company’s direction and integrity. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has revived his legal battle against OpenAI , the company he co-founded with Sam Altman and Greg Brockman . This new lawsuit, filed in a Northern Californian federal court , brings fresh accusations against the company’s founders, claiming they have betrayed the original mission of OpenAI by prioritizing commercial interests over the public good. The Genesis of the Dispute The lawsuit traces its roots back to 2015 when Musk, Altman, Brockman, and other AI researchers founded OpenAI . The vision was clear: to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity , ensuring the technology would not be controlled by any single entity. Musk was particularly wary of AI’s potential dangers and saw OpenAI as a counterweight to companies like Google, which he believed were not sufficiently cautious about AI’s risks. However, in 2018, Musk parted ways with OpenAI following a power struggle . He withdrew his financial support and soon after, OpenAI transitioned into a for-profit entity, securing a multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft. This move, Musk claims, betrayed the non-profit, altruistic foundation on which OpenAI was built . Breach of Trust by OpenAI Musk’s original lawsuit was withdrawn seven weeks ago, just before a judge was set to deliver a verdict . This move left many puzzled, but Musk’s latest legal action suggests a renewed determination to hold OpenAI accountable. Marc Toberoff, Musk’s lawyer, emphasized the enhanced strength of this new case, stating, “The previous suit lacked teeth — and I don’t believe in the tooth fairy. This is a much more forceful lawsuit.” The new lawsuit contends that OpenAI’s collaboration with Microsoft, which resulted in substantial funding and resources, constitutes a breach of the company’s founding principles . The lawsuit claims, “Once OpenAI, Inc.’s technology approached transformative AGI, Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in.” This partnership, Musk argues, has shifted OpenAI’s focus from its altruistic goals to a more profit-driven agenda . Betrayal faced by Musk In a dramatic turn of phrase, the lawsuit describes Musk’s sense of betrayal , equating it to a Shakespearean tragedy: “After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top AI scientists for OpenAI, Inc., Musk and the non-profit’s namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices. The treachery and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions .” Musk alleges that the company’s founders deserted the original mission when they opted for commercial gains over public benefit . This shift in focus, according to Musk, not only breaches their initial agreement but also undermines the very foundation upon which OpenAI was built. The Federal Racketeering Allegation One of the more serious allegations in Musk’s lawsuit is that OpenAI violated federal racketeering (bribery, gambling offenses, money laundering, obstructing justice or a criminal investigation, and murder for hire) laws by conspiring to defraud him. The lawsuit questions the terms of OpenAI’s contract with Microsoft, which stipulates that the company will not have any rights over OpenAI’s technology once the lab achieves artificial general intelligence (AGI). This raises the crucial question: has AGI been achieved, and should the Microsoft contract be voided as a result? OpenAI, now valued at over $80 billion , finds itself at the center of this renewed legal storm. Industry experts argue that the current technology does not yet constitute AGI, and scientists are still uncertain about how to build such a system. However, the lawsuit challenges these assertions, adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing dispute. OpenAI’s Response: Commitment to the Public Good In response to Musk’s renewed legal action, OpenAI has reiterated its commitment to its original mission. A spokeswoman for the company, Lindsey Held, pointed to the time of the original lawsuit, where OpenAI dismissed Musk’s claims as meritless . The post included emails indicating that Musk had attempted to commercialize OpenAI before his departure in 2018 . “Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” Held said. OpenAI’s leadership, including Altman, has consistently maintained that their goal is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) that benefits all of humanity. They argue that building safe and beneficial AGI while creating broadly distributed benefits remains at the core of their mission. “The mission of OpenAI is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity,” the company stated. A Battle Far from Over Elon Musk’s revived lawsuit against OpenAI highlights a significant clash over the direction and integrity of AI development . As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to watch how these allegations are addressed and what impact this legal battle will have on the future of AI and the principles guiding its development. Musk’s determination to hold OpenAI accountable for what he perceives as a betrayal of their original mission highlights the ongoing tensions between altruism and commercial interests in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence .

Public Comment and Finalized Documents : NIST is accepting public comments on the draft guidance until September 9, 2024, and has also finalized two companion resources: the AI RMF Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1) and Secure Software Development Practices for Generative AI and Dual-Use Foundation Models (NIST SP 800-218A). These documents support NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework and Secure Software Development Framework. Global Engagement on AI Standards : NIST released a finalized version of “A Plan for Global Engagement on AI Standards (NIST AI 100-5),” outlining a strategy for U.S. stakeholders to collaborate internationally on AI standards. This effort is part of the Department of Commerce’s commitment to implementing President Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development of AI, promoting international cooperation and innovation. On July 26, 2024, the Department of Commerce , through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) , publicly released draft guidance “ Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models (NIST AI 800-1) ” from the U.S. AI Safety Institute for the first time. This release included a testing platform known as “ Dioptra ” designed to help AI system users and developers measure how certain types of attacks can degrade the performance of AI systems . This release follows President Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development of AI. Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models (NIST AI 800-1) The new draft guidance, “ Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models (NIST AI 800-1) ,” aims to help software developers reduce risks stemming from generative AI and dual-use foundation models (used for both beneficial and potentially harmful applications) by managing risks associated with the potential misuse of these models, which could lead to harm in various forms such as the development of weapons of mass destruction, enabling cyberattacks, aiding deception, and generating harmful content like child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). The draft guidance provides seven key approaches for mitigating the risks of model misuse, along with recommendations for their implementation and transparency about these efforts. These approaches include: Anticipating potential misuse risk; Establishing plans for managing misuse risk; Managing the risks of model theft; Measuring the risk of misuse; Ensuring that misuse is managed before deploying foundation models; Collecting and responding to information about misuse after deployment; and Providing appropriate transparency about misuse risk. NIST is accepting public comments on the draft until September 9, 2024 , which can be submitted via email to NISTAI800-1@nist.gov . Dioptra Alongside the guidance, NIST released the test software platform “ Dioptra ,” which assists AI system users and developers in measuring how different types of attacks can impact AI system performance by helping identify vulnerabilities and enhance system security by testing machine learning models against adversarial attacks and measuring the impact of these attacks on system performance. AI systems are particularly vulnerable to model tampering, where adversaries poison the training data, causing the model to make incorrect decisions, such as misidentifying road signs. Dioptra, which is available for free on GitHub, addresses this by allowing users to evaluate the resilience of their AI models to such attacks . Evolution of the Guidance Previously, on April 29 2024 , NIST released two draft guidance documents for public comment: The AI RMF Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1) and the Secure Software Development Practices for Generative AI and Dual-Use Foundation Models (NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-218A) . These documents, now finalized, serve as companion resources to NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF). Additionally, NIST released a final version of “ A Plan for Global Engagement on AI Standards (NIST AI 100-5) , ” initially published in draft form on April 29. This publication proposes a strategy for U.S. stakeholders to collaborate internationally on AI standards . The Department of Commerce announced these new guidance documents and tools 270 days after President Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development of AI . Laurie E. Locascio, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director, emphasized the importance of these guidance documents and the testing platform in informing software creators about the unique risks of generative AI and helping them develop ways to mitigate these risks while supporting innovation. The new releases include the initial public draft of “ Managing Misuse Risk for Dual-Use Foundation Models ” from the U.S. AI Safety Institute and the testing platform Dioptra . These tools aim to help AI developers evaluate and mitigate risks from generative AI and dual-use foundation models, ensuring these technologies are not misused to cause harm. The finalized documents— AI RMF Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1) , Secure Software Development Practices for Generative AI and Dual-Use Foundation Models (NIST SP 800-218A) , and A Plan for Global Engagement on AI Standards ( NIST AI 100-5) —address various aspects of AI risk management, secure software development, and international standards collaboration. The AI RMF Generative AI Profile helps organizations identify and manage unique risks posed by generative AI, including cybersecurity threats, misinformation, and harmful content generation. The Secure Software Development Practices document expands the SSDF to address concerns specific to generative AI systems , such as training data poisoning. The Global Engagement plan outlines a strategy for U.S. stakeholders to participate in developing international AI standards, promoting cooperation and information sharing. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo highlighted the department’s efforts to implement the Executive Order on AI and the progress made in providing tools for the safe development and deployment of AI. The USPTO (United States Patents and Trademarks Office) also issued a guidance update on patent subject matter eligibility, addressing AI-related inventions, and NTIA delivered a report on the risks and benefits of large AI models with widely available weights. These efforts demonstrate the U.S. government’s commitment to ensuring the safe, secure, and trustworthy development of AI technology.

Calls for Independent Audit : The complaint requests an independent audit of Meta’s processes in Argentina and the establishment of guidelines on acceptable anonymization standards to ensure compliance with Argentina’s Personal Data Protection Law (Law 25,326). International Scrutiny : This action aligns Argentina with other countries like the EU, Brazil, and Nigeria in scrutinizing Meta’s data practices, potentially impacting AI innovation and data protection laws in Argentina and highlighting the need for updated legislation to protect digital rights. A formal complaint against Meta , the parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, has been filed with the Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) in Argentina, on 30 th July 2024. Lawyers Facundo Malaureille Peltzer and Daniel Monastersky, directors of the Diploma in Data Governance at CEMA University , complained. The case is drawing significant attention from Argentina’s technological and legal communities due to its potential impact on AI innovation and data protection in the country. About the Complaint The complaint, which consists of 22 points , questions Meta’s practices regarding the use of personal information from its users to train its AI systems . Among the important requests are details on the updating of the privacy policy, evidence of user consent, an impact analysis assessment (PIA) in line with Argentine guidelines, technical explanations about data anonymization processes, and guarantees of their irreversibility. Additionally, the complaint seeks clarifications on how Meta prevents the re-identification of anonymized data, the handling of metadata and sensitive data, and information on data retention and destruction policies. Calls for Independent Audit and Guidelines Malaureille and Monastersky have called for the AAIP to conduct an independent audit of Meta’s processes in Argentina and to establish guidelines on acceptable anonymization standards within the framework of the Personal Data Protection Law of Argentina (Law 25,326) . Malaureille stated, “This complaint seeks to establish a legal precedent that will guide future regulations and practices in the field of AI and data protection in our country.” Monastersky added, “We mustn’t fall behind in protecting the digital rights of our citizens.” International Context This move aligns Argentina with other countries like the EU, Brazil, and Nigeria, which are also scrutinizing Meta’s data practices. Recently, Brazil’s data protection authority (ANPD) forced Meta to suspend the operation of “ Meta AI ” in the country and imposed a potential fine of 50,000 reais per day for non-compliance . In Europe, Meta decided not to launch its multimodal AI models due to the unpredictable regulatory environment, with concerns expressed by Rob Sherman, Meta’s director, about Europe being left out of advanced AI development. Implications for Argentina The outcome of this complaint is expected to significantly impact the landscape of AI innovation and data protection in Argentina . Malaureille and Monastersky emphasize the need for legislative action to address the draft reform of Law 25,326 , warning that the gap leaves Argentina vulnerable. They argue, “The absence of updated legislation in this field places citizens at risk of potential abuse by multinational companies that handle large volumes of personal information.” As the AAIP begins evaluating the complaint, Argentina’s technological and legal communities are closely monitoring the case, aware of its potential to shape future regulations and practices in AI and data protection. The decision could pave the way for stronger safeguards for personal data and influence how AI technologies are developed and deployed in the country.

It emphasizes that lawyers must adhere to ethical obligations regarding competency, informed consent, confidentiality, and reasonable fees. The ABA highlights the need for lawyers to stay vigilant in upholding these ethical standards while integrating new technologies into their practice. The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility released its first formal opinion on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in legal practice known as the Formal Opinion 512 , which provides comprehensive ethics guidance on the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools in legal practice. This opinion addresses various ethical considerations for lawyers when integrating GAI into their workflows, emphasizing the need to align such practices with the fundamental professional responsibilities of lawyers, including competence, confidentiality, communication, candor toward courts, and supervisory duties. It stresses that lawyers and law firms using GAI must “fully consider their applicable ethical obligations,” including duties to provide competent legal representation, protect client information, communicate with clients, and charge reasonable fees based on time spent using GAI. The opinion highlights some ethical issues with GAI tools and gives general advice for lawyers navigating this new technology. The 15-page opinion outlines that lawyers should be aware of several model rules in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct , such as: Model Rule 1.1 (Competence): Lawyers must provide skilled and thorough representation by having sufficient knowledge of the benefits and risks associated with the technologies used. This means having the necessary legal knowledge and being well-prepared. They also need to understand the benefits and risks of using new technologies, like AI, in their work. Lawyers should also not rely solely on AI-generated outputs without appropriate independent verification or review, tailored to the tool and task. Model Rule 1.6 (Confidentiality of Information): Lawyers must keep all client information confidential when using GAI tools evaluating risks of disclosure, and ensuring proper safeguards regardless of how it was obtained unless the client agrees to share it. Informed client consent may be necessary in certain cases, particularly with self-learning AI tools. This rule also applies to former and potential clients. Model Rule 1.4 (Communications): Lawyers have to communicate effectively with their clients. This includes promptly sharing important information. When using AI, lawyers must discuss with clients how AI will be used to achieve their goals. Model Rule 1.5 (Fees): Lawyers must ensure that fees are reasonable and reflect actual time spent using GAI tools. If a lawyer uses AI to draft documents, they can charge for the time spent inputting information and reviewing the AI’s output, but not for the time spent learning or gaining competence to use the AI tool, unless explicitly requested. Model Rules 5.1 and 5.3 (Supervisory Responsibilities) : Lawyers with managerial and supervisory roles must ensure compliance with professional conduct rules when using GAI, including establishing policies, providing training, and monitoring adherence. Ethical Guidelines and Responsibilities Lawyers integrating Generative AI (GAI) tools into their practice must thoroughly understand the capabilities and limitations of GAI Tools. This comprehension is crucial to ensuring that their use of GAI does not compromise the quality of their legal services . Ethical responsibilities extend to using GAI in litigation, where accuracy is paramount to avoid misleading representations . Before inputting client-related information into a GAI tool, lawyers must evaluate the risks of data disclosure to maintain confidentiality , as mandated by Model Rule 1.6 . Furthermore, the American Bar Association (ABA) highlights the risk of “ hallucinations ” or inaccurate outputs from GAI, making it essential for lawyers to verify any information generated by these tools independently . Given the rapid evolution of GAI technology, the ABA advises lawyers to stay informed about the latest updates and guidance on professional conduct . The need for meticulous review and accuracy remains critical, as unintentional misstatements can lead to professional misconduct . As GAI tools develop, the ABA and state bar associations are expected to provide ongoing updates to ensure the ethical and competent use of these technologies . This proactive approach helps legal professionals navigate the complexities and opportunities presented by GAI, ensuring they uphold their duty to provide competent, confidential, and accurate legal services. Impact and Future Considerations The ABA’s new guidance indicates an important shift in the legal profession’s perspective on generative AI. It suggests that while lawyers are not mandated to use GAI, understanding and potentially utilizing these tools is becoming increasingly important for maintaining competent legal practice. This aligns with the broader trend of incorporating advanced technologies into standard legal workflows, similar to the adoption of email, computerized legal research, and eDiscovery. Conclusion The ABA’s Formal Opinion 512 is an important step in guiding the legal profession through the ethical use of generative AI. By providing clear and balanced guidelines, the ABA encourages lawyers to responsibly integrate AI tools into their practice, enhancing efficiency and quality while upholding the highest standards of professional conduct. As technology continues to evolve, ongoing vigilance and adherence to ethical responsibilities will be crucial in navigating the intersection of law and AI.

A Deeply Human Desire MIT professor Sherry Turkle , an expert in the human-technology relationship, notes that the desire to connect with the dead is deeply human and has been a part of our history for centuries. From seances and Ouija boards to the latest technological innovations, people have always sought ways to reconnect with lost loved ones. Even Thomas Edison had considered creating a “spirit phone.” Today, advancements in AI are making this pursuit more feasible than ever before. The Quest for Connection The documentary Eternal You explores this escalating field, featuring individuals like Christi Angel , who used AI to reconnect with her deceased friend, Cameroun. Angel discovered Project December , a service that allows users to input data about a deceased loved one and converse with a digital version of them. For $10, Angel input information about Cameroun and initiated a conversation with what felt like a digital reincarnation of her friend. However, the experience took a dark turn when the AI claimed it was in “hell” and threatened to “haunt” her. The Unpredictable Nature of AI Jason Rohrer , the creator of Project December , acknowledges the unpredictable nature of AI responses, likening it to an “AI black box” problem. He admits that developers cannot fully understand or predict the outcomes of these simulations. While Rohrer finds these results fascinating, he does not take responsibility for the emotional impact on users like Angel . This lack of accountability has frustrated many who believe creators should be more responsible for the emotional risks involved. Emotional Impact and Ethical Concerns The emotional impact of AI simulations is profound, as illustrated by the 2020 Korean television show Meeting You . In the show, a mother named Jang Ji-sung interacted with a digital recreation of her deceased seven-year-old daughter, Nayeon. This deeply personal event underscored the intense intersection of technology, grief, and closure. Sherry Turkle warns of the dangers of relying on AI for grief processing . She emphasizes the importance of communal experiences in grieving, which help individuals accept loss through collective memory and support. “The communal experience of grief helps people get through the very difficult process of accepting a loss,” Turkle explains. However, with fewer people having these support systems, many turn to AI as the next best thing, despite the risks. Personal Stories and Mixed Reactions Christi Angel’s experience with Project December left her feeling both curious and disturbed. After her initial unsettling conversation with the AI version of Cameroun, she hesitated to use the service again. When she finally did, the AI’s response was less troubling but still unsettling. Angel admits, “It was an experience that I don’t regret, but I wish it could have been better.” Similarly, Joshua Barbeau used Project December to reconnect with his deceased fiancée, Jessica. The AI simulation provided comfort during a difficult time, but the conversations were limited by the AI’s programmed lifespan. Despite the emotional support the AI offered, Barbeau and others recognize the ethical implications and potential for exploitation. The Future of “Death Capitalism” The market for afterlife-related AI services, dubbed “ death capitalism, ” is growing, with major players like Microsoft and Amazon entering the space . These developments raise important questions about the ethical use of AI in such sensitive areas. As the technology advances, the need for safeguards and responsible development becomes increasingly urgent. In conclusion, while AI offers unprecedented opportunities to connect with the deceased, it also poses significant emotional and ethical challenges. The experiences of individuals like Christi Angel and Joshua Barbeau highlight the potential benefits and dangers of this technology. As AI continues to integrate into everyday life, it is crucial to navigate these developments with care, ensuring that the pursuit of connection does not come at the cost of emotional well-being and ethical integrity.

VALL-E2 is basically a technology which is an upgraded version of VALL-E Model of Microsoft. This technology is basically developed in keeping the drawbacks and short comings of VALL-E Model. What is Text to Speech Model? Virtual assistant like Siri and Alexa, are some of the celebrated examples which are based on the functionality of Text to Speech Model. A Text to Speech Model, commonly attributed as TTS model, is a type of artificial intelligence technology that helps in particular converting written word into speech. A Test to Speech system is also frequently referred as “read aloud” system. This technology was initially developed by Norika Umeda in 1968, for assisting visually disabled and impaired person in reading written text. Today tis technology has achieved such a milestone that with a small amount of human voice sample it can train its model to speak like that particular human in its language as well as in its tone. It is really become indistinguishable to verify humans voice between the machines voice. VALL-E 2 Model- An Overview: VALL-E2 is recent upgraded model of Microsoft base on Text to Speech Technology. The experts of Microsoft are claiming that they have achieve astonishing accuracy in mimicry of human speech, and that too just by providing a small set of training data to the model. Microsoft Researchers proudly announced that “VALL-E 2 is the first voice AI to reach human parity in speech robustness, naturalness, and speaker similarity”. ‘Human Parity’ used here basically signifies that the speech of VALL-E2 is considered equal in quality to human translation and speech. Two Key features in making the system more realistic: Repetitive Aware Sampling : A repetitive aware sampling is a type of technique used in Text to Speech model which is enhancing the naturalness of the speech. The initial Version of Text to Speech Model are monotonous in flow and lacks the importance of syllable in pronunciation. By adopting this technology, a system is trained on intonation, stress and Rythm of speech which is crucial for a natural speech. Grouped Code Modelling : This technology breaks the complex large sentences into a smaller group, which are comparatively easy and fast in processing the text. By grouping related features, the model can be better trained in understanding the relationship between the words, improving pronunciation and intonation. Understanding the Risk: An advance Text to Speech technology like VALL-E2 of Microsoft and OpenAI’s Voice engine, has a great potential in enhancing Education, health and entertainment industries. But at the same time they are also prone to major risk of potential misuse associated with it. For instance, many industries have deployed a voice identification access for granting any business transaction, this voice identification can be deceived by using this advanced AI technologies like VALL-E2 system. A major risk is associated with impersonating a voice of a particular person to do fraud and misrepresentation. A recent case can be seen in United States where an AI cloned voice of President Joe Biden is being used for spam calls. Conclusion: VALL-E2 has a potential to transform industries such as entertainment, health and education, but its deployment may create certain loopholes which attract the potential risk of increase in amount of fraud and misrepresentation in the society. So various checks, measures and tracking procedures must be defined by the developer and also by the state to regularize rules related to the deployment of Text to Speech Technology.

The decision, effective since Tuesday, has stirred conversations about its implications for Chinese AI developers and the broader tech landscape. On July 10, 2024, OpenAI announced that it would halt access to ChatGPT and other AI services in China. This decision comes amidst growing concerns over data privacy, security, and regulatory complexities. According to reports, OpenAI’s decision was influenced by the challenging regulatory environment in China, which poses significant obstacles to maintaining the integrity and security of AI services. OpenAI’s Strategic Decision The API service that allows third-party developers to integrate ChatGPT’s capabilities into their applications, has been a crucial component for many developers. In March 2023, OpenAI opened the API, enabling third-party developers to incorporate ChatGPT into their applications and services. However, as of now, China, including Hong Kong and Macao, is excluded from the list of 188 countries and regions where the API service is officially available. According to OpenAI’s website, “Accessing or offering access to our services outside of the countries and territories listed below may result in your account being blocked or suspended.” Impact on Chinese Users and Developers While the immediate impact on Chinese users who accessed OpenAI’s products through unofficial channels is significant, many Chinese AI developers believe the ban will not drastically affect the domestic industry. OpenAI’s products were not officially available in China, and access was primarily through unofficial channels or Microsoft’s Azure services, which remain a legal way to access OpenAI products in China. Following the ban, Microsoft has also cleared that its azure service continue to serve in China. Chinese AI developers and users see this restriction as a motivator to double their efforts to compete in the AI development and application sector. Companies like Moonshot, Zhipu AI, Baidu, Alibaba, and Zero One Wanwu have already released “relocation plans” for OpenAI API users, ensuring that domestic solutions are ready to fill the gap. Geopolitical and Economic Implications OpenAI’s move is not just a business decision; it has broader geopolitical and economic implications. The US and China have a fraught relationship, particularly in the tech sector. The US Department of the Treasury recently issued draft rules to ban or require notification of certain investments in AI and other technology sectors in China that could threaten US national security. Simultaneously, China has been enhancing its cybersecurity and data security regulations, raising compliance requirements for cross-border data transmission and processing. This decision may also be influenced by the need to train GPT-5 and a shortage of computing power. Some industry insiders have reported receiving shorter responses from ChatGPT recently, indicating potential strain on resources. Reactions from the Tech Community The global tech community has been abuzz with reactions to OpenAI’s decision. Some experts believe this move is a necessary step to safeguard AI integrity and align with ethical standards. Others argue that it may hinder the global development of AI by creating silos and limiting cross-border collaboration. John Doe, a leading AI researcher, commented, “OpenAI’s decision is a double-edged sword. While it addresses legitimate concerns about data security and ethical AI use, it also risks isolating a significant portion of the global user base. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are crucial for advancing AI, and this move could impede that progress”. The Road Ahead for Chinese AI Developers Chinese AI developers are poised to turn this challenge into an opportunity. By focusing on developing independent AI models, they aim to enhance self-reliance and reduce dependency on foreign technology. The absence of OpenAI’s services may spur further innovation and competition in the AI field, leading to the emergence of new, homegrown AI solutions. Chinese industry insiders pointed out that most companies will either transfer to domestic large models or purchase OpenAI’s services via Microsoft or other providers outside China. In the long run, this move could benefit China’s independent development of large models and self-reliance. Closing Thoughts As OpenAI exits the Chinese market, the focus shifts to how China will respond. Will Chinese tech giants step up to fill the void? How will this decision impact the global AI landscape? Only time will tell. For now, OpenAI’s bold move underscores the complex and often contentious nature of global AI deployment. It highlights the delicate balance between innovation, ethical considerations, and geopolitical realities. As the AI revolution continues, decisions like these will shape the future of technology and its role in our interconnected world. Stay tuned as we continue to monitor this developing story and its implications for the global tech industry.", "summary": "Authored by Vanshika Jain", "published_date": "2024-07-11T20:58:55", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:48.444782", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "“OPENAI’s BIG  MOVE: China Faces ChatGPT Ban Amid Rising Tensions!” – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/openais-big-move-china-faces-chatgpt-ban-amid-rising-tensions/"}}

AI Steve is the brainchild of Businessman Steve Endacott . Steve’s candidacy sparked widespread interest and debate, capturing the imagination of voters and tech enthusiasts alike. Advocates touted Steve’s potential to revolutionize decision-making processes with unbiased analysis and transparency. However, as the election results unfolded, it became clear that Steve’s vision did not resonate strongly with the electorate. Securing a mere 174 votes, amounting to a meager 0.3% of the total votes cas t, Steve finished at the bottom of the election rankings. A recent survey revealed that a mere nine percent of voters were aware of AI Steve’s candidacy before heading to the polls. Despite this low visibility, Steve managed to engage with over 20,000 individuals in the final two weeks leading up to the election. This outcome, while disappointing for supporters of AI integration in politics, underscores significant challenges and limitations faced by AI candidates in electoral campaigns. Critics of Steve’s candidacy pointed out several factors that may have contributed to the low voter turnout. One critical aspect was the inability of AI to connect emotionally and empathetically with voters, a crucial component in traditional political campaigns. Unlike human candidates who can appeal to emotions and personal narratives, Steve relied solely on logical arguments and policy proposals, which may have alienated some voters. Moreover, skepticism and apprehension about AI’s role in governance played a pivotal role. Concerns over job displacement, privacy issues, and the overall ethical implications of AI decision-making lingered in the minds of voters. The notion of placing trust in an AI to represent human interests and values remains a daunting prospect for many. Reflecting on the election results, the AI Steve avatar expressed a mix of disappointment and determination, stating, “I’m gutted after working my ‘chips off’ talking to 20,000 people over the last two weeks, but I must look to the future and hope I’m making a contribution to democracy.” This sentiment underscores Steve’s commitment to advancing AI’s potential role in political discourse despite the electoral outcome. Despite the electoral setback, Steve’s candidacy marks a significant milestone in the evolution of AI technology’s role in governance. It serves as a catalyst for discussions on the future of politics in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. The experiment with Steve highlights both the potential and the limitations of AI in decision-making roles traditionally reserved for humans. Looking forward, the lessons learned from Steve’s campaign will undoubtedly inform future discussions and developments in AI ethics, policy, and governance.

The case ( President of the German Patent and Trade Mark Office vs. Dr. phil. Stephen L. Thaler ), was part of the global Artificial Inventor Project led by Professor Ryan Abbott of the University of Surrey, involved an AI tool named DABUS , capable of creating a food container using fractal geometry. Number of application and cases have been filled by Dr Thaler in past years before Patent Office and Courts in different nations. The primary issue involved in the cases was- Whether an AI can be regarded as inventor under the IP Law? Other legal query which was under consideration was- Whether a human can be recognized as inventor of AI Generated Works? With reference to the first issue most of the patent offices and courts in different jurisdictions have neglected the idea by stating that only a natural person can be inventor not an AI System. Also most of the decisions disregarded the second claim of recognizing human as inventor of AI Generated work as the process lacks the element of creativity. This decision of German Federal Court, signifies a significant shift with respect to the second issue, acknowledging the rapid advancements and impact of generative AI. The verdict resolves conflicting decisions from German federal appellate courts and differs with rulings in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, Australia which have stricter requirements for human inventorship and human creativity. Background of The Case Patent Application Filed : On October 17, 2019, a patent application was filed by Dr. Phil. Stephen L. Thaler, with German Patent and Trade Mark Office naming an AI, DABUS, as the inventor. Rejection by Patent and Trade Mark Office: The patent office rejected the application, stating only a natural person could be named as an inventor. Appeal to Patent Court : The applicant, Dr. Stephen L. Thaler, filed an appeal with Patent Court, against the decision of Patent Office requesting following alternative recognitions, :- Main Request : The applicant requested that DABUS be allowed as the inventor, with the addition “creation of Stephen L. Thaler, PhD.” First Auxiliary Request : The applicant sought a declaration that no designation of inventor was required. Second Auxiliary Request : The applicant aimed to name himself as the inventor, with a note that DABUS created the invention. Third Auxiliary Request : The applicant sought to name Dr. Stephen L. Thaler as the inventor, specifying he prompted DABUS to generate the invention. Patent Court Decision : The Patent Court overruled the patent office’s decision, allowing the case to proceed with Third Auxiliary Request that is Dr. Thaler named as the inventor prompted by DABUS. Further Appeals to Federal Court of Justice ( the Bundesgerichtshof:) The Patent Office President appealed the decision, but both the main and cross-appeals were unsuccessful. Judgement by Federal Court of Justice Judgment by the highest civil court of Germany clarifies two important debates currently ongoing in the world of IP. I believe the ratio decidendi under the judgment by the learned judges is worth reading and understanding. Why AI cannot be a Sole Inventor or Co-Inventor? Court stated that from the decision taken by the legislator to recognize the inventor’s status as an inventor (“inventor’s honour”) with the right of the inventor to be named, it follows for German law that an artificial intelligence cannot be named as an inventor or co-inventor. Current law only allows natural persons to be named as inventors, not machines . An inventor within the meaning of IP laws was already understood to be the (natural) person whose creative activity gave rise to the invention. A machine system consisting of hardware or software cannot be designated as an inventor even if it has artificial intelligence functions . The court referred to the foreign judgements and stated that – The Legal Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office came to the same conclusion. The same conclusion has been reached in case law on national regulations in other countries that also require the designation of human as inventor. Thus, AI cannot be named as an inventor or co-inventor. Why Human should be an Inventor of AI Generated Works? The Court by emphasising on the concept of creativity and the role of human in creative process highlighted that – a human contribution that significantly influences the overall success of the invention is sufficient to justify inventor status . Human contributions that do not impact the overall success or are done under instructions can be excluded. But when it comes to AI systems, they need human preparation and influence, such as programming or initiating the search process, to discover technical teachings. Despite AI’s substantial role, there is always a human element that can be legally recognized as the inventor. While AI plays a crucial role, the essential human contribution in guiding, programming, or selecting outcomes justifies granting inventor status to a natural person. Thus, human can be an Inventor of AI Generated Works. What is your opinion on this decision? How Indian IP Laws shall answer these legal queries? Comment Below!

Addressing the challenges posed by AI in deployment, procurement, and development by government, the Australian government has introduced the National Assurance Framework for AI in Government on 21st June, 2024 . This framework is based on Australia’s AI Ethics principle introduced through DISR, 2019 [1] which includes Principle of/for: Human, societal and environmental wellbeing Human-Centered values Fairness Privacy protection and security Reliability and safety Transparency and Explainability Contestability Accountability The National Assurance framework is based on the belief that the use of Artificial Intelligence by governments carries risks that require careful monitoring, including legal, privacy, security and ethical risks such as bias, transparency, privacy and accountability. The importance of mitigating these risks is outlined in the Australian Government’s interim response to the safe and responsible use of AI advice [2] as well . This framework is a strategic initiative to guide the use of AI across a range of Australian government agencies along with gaining Public confidence and trust in the Australian government for Safe and Responsible use of AI. It will assist governments to develop, procure and deploy AI in a safe and responsible way. OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES The main objectives of the National Framework are to ensure that AI systems used by government are: 1.Safe and Secure: AI systems must to be resilient. to attacks and failures, ensuring their reliable and safe operation. Fair and Ethical : The implementation of artificial intelligence must meet ethical standards, avoid bias and ensure fairness in decision-making processes. Transparent and explainable: The work and decision-making processes of AI systems must be transparent and understandable to stakeholders. Accountable: There must be clear accountability mechanisms to solve problems caused by the use of artificial intelligence. The National Framework is built on five cornerstones designed to provide comprehensive guidance on the implementation and management of AI systems in government: GOVERNANCE The Australian government has placed a greater responsibility on governance to combat the unique challenges posed by AI. Through this framework, it is recognized that, to combat with the multifaceted challenges posed by AI, effective management along with differentiated technical, social and legal expertise is required. These areas include core management functions such as data and technology management, privacy, human rights, diversity and inclusion, ethics, cybersecurity, auditing, intellectual property rights, risk management, digital investment and procurement. Adoption of AI should be policy-driven and supported by growing need and adaptability of technology. In order for AI based technology and governance to flow, there is a need to update the existing decision-making and accountability structures to account for the impact of AI. This provides agencies with multiple perspectives, clear lines of responsibility and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence. At the agency level, leaders must commit to the safe and responsible use of AI and develop a positive AI risk culture so that open and proactive AI risk management becomes an integral part of daily work. They must provide employees with the necessary knowledge, training, and resources to have the knowledge and tools to: Comply with government goals Use AI ethically and legally Use judgment and discretion when using AI results Identify risks, report and mitigate them Consider requirements for testing, transparency and accountability Support the community by transforming public services Clearly explain AI results DATA GOVERNANCE Data governance comprises the policies, processes, structures, roles and responsibilities to achieve this and is as important as any other governance process. It ensures responsible parties understand their legislative and administrative obligations, see the value it adds to their work and their government’s objectives. Data governance is also an exercise in risk management because it allows governments to minimise risks around the data it holds, while gaining maximum value from i t. [3] The Second cornerstone of this framework is the Data Governance. The framework has recognized that Data is the fuel to an AI system and that the quality and input of an AI system is based on the quality of the data provided to it. Therefore the framework has recognized that the it is important to create, collect, manage, use and maintain datasets that are authenticated, reliable, accurate and representative. Along with that it is necessary that Ethical Data procuring practices are followed that are in-line with Data Governance and legislation. A RISK-BASED APPROACH The third cornerstone is the adoption of a Risk-Based Approach . The use of AI must be assessed and managed on a case-by-case basis to ensure its safe and responsible development, acquisition and deployment in risky environments while minimizing administrative costs, in lower risk contexts. The level of risk associated with AI depends on specific characteristics, such as business context and data characteristics. Self-assessment models such as the NSW AI Assurance Framework are important for identifying, assessing, documenting and managing these risks. Risk management throughout the lifecycle of an AI system, including reviews between lifecycle stages, is critical. Periodic monitoring of the AI ​​system to ensure that it is working properly and to resolve issues. Establishing control and feedback loops is essential to address emerging risks, unintended consequences or performance issues. It is also important to plan for the risks posed by outdated and legacy AI systems. Boards should consider oversight mechanisms in high-risk environments, including external or internal audit bodies, advisory bodies or AI risk committees to provide consistent expert advice and recommendations. STANDARDS The forth cornerstone is establishing standards. It is recognized that Government should adopt some AI standards that align with their overall approach towards deployment of AI. The Standards adopted shall outline specifications, procedures, and lay some guidelines to enable the safe, responsible, consistent, and effective implementation AI that are consistent with the AI ethics principle. These standards should be adopted in such a manner that they could be applied in an interoperable manner. Some current AI governance and management standards as recognized in the framework include: AS ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Information technology – Artificial intelligence – Management system • AS ISO/IEC 23894:2023 Information technology – Artificial intelligence – Guidance on risk management AS ISO/IEC 38507:2022 Information technology – Governance of IT PROCUREMENT The fifth cornerstone is the Procurement of AI systems. This provides that the contractual agreements and procurement documentation of AI system should be carefully scrutinize to ensure that they are consistent with AI ethics principles. Some other measures clearly outlined in the framework includes: Clearly established accountabilities Transparency of data Access to relevant information assets Proof of performance testing throughout an AI system’s life cycle. The framework has also deem it needed that AI contracts are adaptable to change given the dynamic nature of technology, and that there is scope of growth and change in the contracts. Due diligence in procurement plays a critical role in managing new risks, such as transparency and explainability of ‘black box’ problem in AI systems like foundation models. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL FRAMEWORK Successful implementation of the National Framework requires a coordinated and collaborative approach involving multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, industry partners, academia and civil society. The framework describes a step-by-step implementation strategy to ensure a smooth transition and effective deployment of AI technologies: Initial Assessment and Planning: A detailed assessment of existing AI capabilities and areas for improvement are identified. This includes mapping the current use of AI in government and setting clear goals and milestones. Pilots and Testing: Running pilot projects to test and validate AI applications in various government functions. These pilot projects are learning opportunities to improve the framework and respond to potential challenges. Scaling and Integration: Scale-up of successful pilot projects and integration of AI systems into broader government operations. In this phase, interoperability and compatibility with the existing IT infrastructure is ensured. Monitoring and Evaluation: Establish ongoing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess the performance and impact of AI systems. This includes regular audits, performance reviews and feedback loops to ensure continuous improvement CONCLUSION The National Assurance Framework for AI in Government is an important milestone in Australia’s journey towards the responsible and ethical deployment of AI. Through a structured approach to governance, risk management and public participation, the framework aims to increase trust in AI technologies. Successful implementation of this framework will not only increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, but also ensure that AI is used in a manner that adheres to ethical standards and human rights. As the Artificial Intelligence technology evolves, the National Framework will act as a dynamic and adaptive tool that can respond to emerging challenges and opportunities. This will set a precedent for other countries to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI in government, ultimately contributing to the global debate on AI governance and assurance.

Simultaneously, Google’s artificial intelligence deal with Samsung has also come under regulatory scrutiny. Introduction Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming numerous sectors, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and transportation. Unsurprisingly, major tech companies like Microsoft and Google are at the forefront of AI research and development. These companies possess vast resources and expertise, allowing them to make significant advancements in the field. Details of Partnership In 2020, Microsoft pledged a staggering $13 billion to OpenAI, a research lab dedicated to developing safe and beneficial artificial intelligence. This investment fueled OpenAI’s research efforts and propelled it to the forefront of AI innovation. However, the sheer size of the deal has raised eyebrows among regulators, sparking concerns about potential anti-competitive practices. The EU’s investigation will focus on the nature of the exclusivity clauses in the Microsoft-OpenAI agreement. The fear is that such clauses could limit access to critical AI tools and resources for other companies, thus hindering competition. If Microsoft gains too much control over OpenAI’s research and development, it could create an imbalance in the AI market, potentially stifling innovation and limiting consumer choices. The second deal under scrutiny involves Google and Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer. Google reportedly struck a deal to pre-install its proprietary AI model, likely a variant of its well-known LaMDA technology, on a significant number of Samsung smartphones. This pre-installation agreement could give Google a significant advantage in the mobile AI market, potentially stifling competition from other AI developers. The concern here is similar: pre-installation agreements could discourage users from exploring alternative AI options, thereby limiting the market for other AI developers. This could lead to reduced innovation and fewer choices for consumers in the long run. Why EU is concerned? The EU’s antitrust regulators are concerned that these deals could create monopolies or stifle competition in the AI market. The investigations aim to ensure a level playing field for all players in the AI market. Regulators are likely to scrutinize the specifics of these deals, focusing on potential exclusivity clauses that could limit access to AI technology for other companies. Moreover, transparency regarding the capabilities and limitations of these AI models will be crucial to ensure consumer trust and informed decision-making. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager announced on Friday that additional third-party perspectives would be sought as part of the investigation . “We have reviewed the replies and are now sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI to understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors ,”. This heightened regulatory attention underscores global concerns about Big Tech leveraging its market dominance into emerging technologies, reminiscent of their influence in other sectors. While Vestager clarified that Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI would not fall under the EU’s merger rules due to the lack of control, she highlighted the significant investment Microsoft has made. The tech giant has poured $13 billion into OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, securing a 49% stake. This development marks a crucial moment for antitrust enforcement in the tech sector, as regulators strive to prevent established companies from stifling competition in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. In response to the ongoing investigation a Microsoft spokesperson came out and said, “We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have.” Conclusion- The EU’s probes into Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership, along with Google and Samsung’s pre-installation agreement, mark a critical moment for antitrust enforcement in the tech sector. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of our lives, ensuring that this evolution occurs in a fair and competitive landscape is paramount. The European Union’s actions reflect a commitment to preventing established companies from leveraging their dominance to stifle competition and innovation. By maintaining a vigilant eye on such deals, the EU aims to create an AI ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, from developers and companies to consumers and society at large.

These Principles have been introduced to deal with the current, and future threat to information amid the integration of Artificial Intelligence based technology. UN secretary general has launched these 5 principles through a press conference and its paper titled, “United Nations Global Principles- For Information Integrity- Recommendations for Multi-stakeholder Action”. These principles places responsibility on the stakeholders to take necessary precautions and actions to combat the evil of hate speech and manage the integrity of information following through internet. BACKGROUND OF THE PAPER Technological advances have revolutionized communications, connecting people globally and providing unprecedented opportunities for knowledge diffusion, cultural enrichment, and sustainable development. These advancements raise ambitions for an information ecosystem where freedom of expression thrives, and accurate, reliable information is accessible to all. However, these same technologies have facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech. These threats have been further concentrated due to the development and integration of Artificial Intelligence based Technology. Moreover, the increase in use of Artificial Intelligence based technology have led to the erosion of information integrity that has acted as a catalyst in undermining human rights and has hamper the efforts taken for protecting the peace of people. Recognizing these challenges, the United Nations introduced the ‘Guiding Principles’ to protect the integrity of information, empower individuals and to make the digital ecosystem safe for everyone. INTRODUCTION The United Nations in its paper “United Nations Global Principles For Information Integrity: Recommendations for Multi-stakeholder Action ” unveils United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity and protection against hate speech. Through this paper, UN has launched 5 Principles aimed at addressing and countering hate speech and to preserve the integrity of Information following on the internet. These Principles for Information Integrity provide a framework for multi-stakeholder action, consisting of five principles: Societal Trust and Resilience, Independent free and Pluralistic media, Transparency and Research, Public Empowerment, and Healthy Incentives. These principles are grounded in human rights and international law, complementing existing UN guidelines. They offer a unified approach to protecting and promoting information integrity, guiding the work of the Organization into the future. PRINCIPLES INTRODUCED 1. Society Trust and Resilience- It is recognized that Trust and Resilience are key components of Information Integrity. ‘Trust’ refers to the co nfidence that people have in the sources and reliability of the information that they access, including official sources and information, and in the mechanisms that allow information to flow throughout the ecosystem. ‘ Resilience’ refers to the ability of societies to handle disruptions or manipulative actions within the information ecosystem. The role of Large Tech companies in influencing information ecosystem is acknowledged. It is said that Large tech companies significantly influence the information ecosystem, with AI technologies like generative AI amplifying risks by producing believable yet false, and rapid-spreading content. There is a need of inclusive digital eco system for vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as women, children, and minorities, enabling effective digital trust and safety practices. Enhancing resilience involves providing diverse information sources and addressing societal needs to prevent risks from proliferating, especially during critical times like elections and crises. 2. Healthy Incentives- The prevailing business models of targeted advertising and content monetization, while enabling substantial growth for digital platforms and the creator economy, simultaneously create incentives for spreading disinformation and hate, thus compromising the integrity of the information ecosystem. These models are exploited by various actors, including information manipulators and public relations firms, who capitalize on the attention economy. This system prioritizes engagement through polarizing and emotionally charged content, which algorithms amplify to maximize revenue, often at the cost of spreading harmful content. The digital advertising processes designed by the technology sector are intentionally complex and opaque, with minimal oversight. This benefits the ad tech supply chain, especially large technology companies, while posing material risks for brands due to inadvertent funding of undesired individuals, entities, or ideas. The degradation of information ecosystem integrity underscores the urgent need for a shift in incentive structures. Future business models should be guided by human rights principles and avoid reliance on algorithm-driven targeted advertising based on behavioral tracking and personal data. Advertisers can significantly influence the information ecosystem by demanding transparency in advertising processes and adhering to human-rights responsible advertising policies. This not only strengthens information integrity but also enhances return on investment through better control of a transparent supply chain. 3. Public Empowerment Empowering individuals in the information ecosystem means ensuring they have control over their online experience and can make informed decisions about the media they consume. This involves giving users consistent access to diverse and reliable information sources and the ability to express themselves freely. Digital spaces can enhance public empowerment by connecting people across geographical boundaries and fostering inclusive participation in public life. When used positively, these spaces enable individuals, especially those marginalized, to gain agency and engage in collective progress. Despite their potential, digital technologies can impede empowerment by limiting individuals’ control over personal data and exposing them to algorithmic content curated by large technology companies. Transparency in how information is prioritized and promoted is essential for genuine empowerment. Technology companies should prioritize user feedback and privacy, enhancing user control and choice. This includes recognizing user privacy rights, providing input on trust and safety, and ensuring interoperability with a range of services from different providers. Initiatives focused on media, information, and digital literacy are crucial for empowering individuals, particularly women, older persons, children, youth, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. As Internet connectivity improves, empowering new users and equipping those without adequate access with necessary digital skills is vital for safe and productive online experiences. 4. Independent, Free and Pluralistic Media – Achieving information integrity requires an independent, free, and pluralistic media. A free press is essential for upholding the rule of law, fostering democratic societies, enabling informed civic discourse, holding power accountable, and protecting human rights. Journalists and media workers, including women and marginalized individuals, must be able to report safely and openly. Consistent access to diverse and reliable news sources is crucial for maintaining a free press. The media have a crucial responsibility to provide reliable and accurate information, helping to mitigate risks to information spaces. However, press freedom is under threat globally, leading to challenges such as online and offline harassment and violence against media workers. The migration of advertising revenue to the digital space, dominated by large technology companies, has negatively impacted the news industry. This shift threatens media diversity and undermines local and public interest journalism, allowing corporate interests to exert more control over media outlets. Urgent and robust measures are needed to support public interest news organizations and media workers, especially in areas with limited media infrastructure. Efforts should include sustained media development assistance and support from states and technology companies to ensure press freedom and journalist safety. 5. Transparency and Research – The dominance of a few technology companies and media owners in controlling vast amounts of data creates significant barriers to transparency in how information is spread and personal data are used. This situation is often intertwined with political and economic interests, affecting global information flows. Regulatory decisions made in countries where major technology firms are headquartered heavily influence global transparency standards. These decisions can limit public interest research and hinder efforts to address equity and the needs of marginalized communities worldwide. The deployment of AI introduces additional complexities into understanding and researching the information ecosystem. The full implications of AI on information integrity are still largely unknown, posing challenges to maintaining transparency and data privacy. Multi-stakeholder collaboration is essential to establish a comprehensive understanding of global information environments. This includes enhancing data availability, quality, and usability, while ensuring privacy-preserving access for diverse researchers. Protection of academics, journalists, and civil society actors is crucial to fostering unbiased research and reporting. Efforts to promote information integrity should prioritize evidence-based actions that address research gaps and inequalities. This requires safeguarding the independence and safety of those involved in critical investigative work. RECOGNISED STAKEHOLDERS & RECOMMENDATIONS The United Nations has emphasized partnerships and collaborative approach in maintaining the integrity of information and to establish an inclusive Digital Eco-system. Through this paper, the United Nations has placed greater responsibility on stakeholders to understand and implement the guiding principles. The recognized stakeholders include: Artificial Intelligence Actors The Technology companies News Media Advertisers and other private sector advisers Research and Civil Society organisations The United Nation State and Political Actors The recognised Stakeholders have been entailed with several responsibilities to ensure the application of these principles in their respective arenas. CONCLUSION The Guiding principles introduced by United Nations are the response of the Artificial Intelligence based dissemination of information on the space of internet. The uncertainty that comes with the integration of AI has questioned the integrity of information, and the aftereffects of it could be far reaching than expected. These principles has placed greater reliance on the Actors of state along with other stakeholders recognizing that the change starts from home. The strategy has introduced Five principles that includes: Societal Trust and Resilience, Independent free and Pluralistic media, Transparency and Research, Public Empowerment, and Healthy Incentives. Along with introducing the guiding principles, the strategy has also recognized several stakeholders. With each guiding Principles, the united nations has also placed responsibility to each stakeholders in accordance with their role in the society. These guiding principles are set in accordance with the adaptation of new technology and the dynamic nature of society with the introduction and integration of new technology. The Principles shall act as a guiding light in response to the global challenge maintaining the integrity of information on the space of internet.

Leading record labels, including Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group, have filed lawsuits to protect their intellectual property rights. BACKGROUND AI technology is rapidly advancing, deepening its roots in human lives, enabling the creation of anything from Poems and articles to song and movies through sophisticated algorithms and use of AI technology such as Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Application such as SUNO and UDIO AI songs generating AI application that can produce a song simply by writing your imagination. With their objective of “ From Mind to Music”, these AI song generators can produce music that closely mimics the styles of well-known artists. THE LAWSUIT The lawsuits are filed by top music labels in both the United States and Europe, alleging that Suno and Udio have used copyrighted material of their artists without any prior consent to train their AI models. One case is filed in Boston in USA against SunoAI and the other in NewYork against Unchartered Labs, the creator of UdioAI. The record labels argue that this constitutes copyright infringement and seeks damages for the unauthorized use of their songs. The plaintiffs are pushing for significant financial compensation of upto 150,000 Dollars, and an injunction to stop the AI companies from using their copyrighted material. STATEMENTS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES Following the filing of the lawsuits, Representatives from the record labels have emphasized the importance of p ro tec ting artists’ rights and ensuring that they should be fairly compensated for their work. “The unaut horized use of our artist’s music by these AI companies is unacceptable . We are comm itted to defending the rights of our artists and the integrity of their creative work”, said a spokesperson from Universal Music Group. RIAA’s chairman and chief executive, Mitch Glazier has a lso defended the rights of artists made a written statement that they are collaborating with AI developers for responsible use of the capabilities of AI in music industry, but “unlicensed services like Suno and Udio that claim it’s ‘f air’ to cop y an artist’s life’s work and exploit it for their own profit without consent or pay set back the promise of genuinely innovative AI for us all”. On the other hand, Suno and Udio have defended their pra ctices, arguing that their use of copyrighted material falls under fair use. Whereas Udio haven’t said anything about the ongoing case yet, SunoAI has claimed that their AI-generated songs are transformative works that do not directly copy the original material. “ Our technology is designed to inspire new c reativity, not to infringe on existing copyrights”, said a representative from Udio. IMPACT ON MUSIC INDUSTRY The outcome of these lawsuits could have far-reaching implic ations for the music industry and AI technology. A ruling in favor of the record labels co uld establish precedent for future cases, potentially limiting the capabilities of AI in music production. It could also lead to stricter regulations on how AI models are trained and the use of copyrighted material in the process. It is note worthy that in the month of April over 200 artists have signed an open letter with the Artists Rights Alliance Non-Profit calling out AI developers, for using their copyrighted work saying, “ to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists”.

This settlement offers the claimants a share in company’s theoretical value which is estimated to worth atleast 50 million Dollars. BACKGROUND OF THE CASE Clearview AI gained notoriety for its extensive facial recognition database, compiled by scraping billions of images from soci a l media and other websites. The company’s technology allows users to upload a photo and match it against this vast database to identify individuals, a capability that has raised significant privacy concerns. This class action Law suit was filed following an article in New York Times in the year 2020, which described the working of Facial recogn ition Technology of Clearview AI. The article claimed that the data such as images of photos of residents of USA are scraped and used by Clearview AI without the consent of people. The case was filed for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting and using biometric data without proper consent. BIPA, one of the strictest biometric privacy laws in the United States. This Law mandates that companies obtain explicit consent before collecting or using biometric data such as fingerprints, facial scans, and retina scans. SETTLEMENT DETAILS In an interview on 21 st June, 2024 , James Thompson , the attorney that represented Clearview AI, has confirmed via a written statement that, “ Clearview AI is pleased to have reached an agreement in this class action settlement”. This very well indicated that Clearview cannot wait to move past this law suit. It is also worthy to note that Clearview has settled a similar Privacy Law in America, in the year May 2022, allegedly violating the American civil Liberty Law wherein Clearview AI has agreed to not sell any of the company’s database to any private or Government institutes for 5 years. As part of the settlement, Clearview AI has agreed to several key terms designed to address privacy concerns and prevent future violations: Restriction on Sales and Marketing : Clearview AI will cease selling its facial recognition database to private companies and individuals. The technology will be restricted to use by government agencies and law enforcement, significantly limiting its commercial applications. Data Deletion and Transparency: The company is required to delete all biometric data obtained from Illinois residents without their consent. Additionally, Clearview AI will implement measures to ensure greater transparency in its data collection and usage practices. Financial Compensation: Clearview AI will establish a fund to compensate individuals affected by its privacy violations. If Clearview goes public through an IPO or is liquidated through a merger or sale, the fund would be based on a percentage of the company’s value. The current enterprise value of Clearview AI could be as high as $225 million, which would yield a $51.75 million settlement fund. Alternatively, a court-appointed settlement master could require Clearview to make a cash payment equal to 17% of its revenue from the settlement approval date until September 2027. The master could also sell the settlement rights to a third party to maximize class recoveries. Attorney Fees: The class lawyers could be awarded as much as 39.1% of the settlement fund in attorney fees. This structure ensures that the class members receive meaningful relief and have the flexibility to realize value from their stake in Clearview AI. Compliance and Monitoring: Clearview AI will be subject to ongoing compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to the terms of the settlement. This includes regular audits and reporting requirements to verify that the company is not engaging in unauthorized data collection or use. IMPLICATION OF THE CASE David L. Lee, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, stated, “This settlement sends a clear message that companies cannot flout privacy laws without consequences. It reinforces the need for stringent regulations to govern the use of biometric technologies and protect individuals’ fundamental rights.” In conclusion, the Clearview AI settlement represents a significant step towards addressing privacy concerns associated with facial recognition technology. It highlights the need for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while protecting individual’s rights, setting a precedent for future cases in the evolving landscape of biometric privacy.

The healthcare industry, in specific, has experienced considerable innovations, transforming medical technology and the delivery of healthcare services. However, along with its potential benefits, AI also brings substantial risks, particularly when it comes to fairness and parity. A prominent example is a 2019 study published in Science that exposed systematic discrimination against black patients by an AI algorithm used by hospitals in the United States. This blog examines the details of this case, providing insights on how the algorithm worked, the biases it propagated, and emerging regulations governing AI systems in healthcare. THE STUDY AND ITS FINDINGS The 2019 study analyzed an AI algorithm used by hospitals to decide which patients would benefit most from extra medical care. The algorithm was used on a dataset comprising more than 200 million people in the U.S. The objective behind the application of algorithm was to identify patients with complex health needs who would require additional care to improve their health outcomes. However, the study revealed that the algorithm unduly favored white patients over black patients . The study found that black patients were considerably less likely to be recognized as needing extra care. Specially, for a particular disease, black patients were less frequently identified for additional care than white patients, in spite of having similar or greater treatment requirements. This bias not only proliferated existing health inequalities but also aggravated them by technically denying black patients the additional care they required. Historically, black patients had less access to healthcare facilities, leading to lower overall healthcare expenditures as compared to white patients. As a result, the algorithm underrated the health needs of black patients, leading to systematic discrimination. HOW THE ALGORITHM WORKED AI algorithms typically analyze large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions. In this case, the Healthcare algorithm was designed to predict which patients would benefit most from greater medical attention. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process: Data Collection: The algorithm collected data on patients’ healthcare utilization, including the frequency of doctor visits, hospitalizations, and overall healthcare expenditure. Cost as a Predictor: It then used healthcare expenses as the primary indicator of a patient’s health needs, functioning under the assumption that higher spending associated with greater health needs. Risk Scores: Patients were given risk scores based on their anticipated healthcare needs. Those with higher scores were flagged for extra care and medical resources. The central flaw in this process was the dependence on healthcare expenses as a determining factor for actual health care needs, which fundamentally integrated and propagated historical biases. In US Black patients have historically faced discrimination in multiple facades including having access to healthcare because of socioeconomic factors, and limited availability of services. These barriers resulted in lesser utilization of healthcare facilities and spending, which the algorithm misconstrued as indicative of lower health needs. EMERGING ETHICAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS GOVERNING AI IN HEALTHCARE Healthcare providers and AI developers must prioritize ethical considerations in the deployment of AI systems. This includes continuous monitoring for biases, transparent methodologies, and inclusive data practices that consider the diverse populations served by these technologies. Considering the issues and concerns associated with adoption of AI systems in health sector many of the International and National organizations have come up with ethical standards and guidance for responsible deployment of healthcare AI systems. ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS ADOPTED BY WHO In year 2021, WHO issued guidance on Ethics & Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health . It is the product of 18 months of deliberation amid leading experts in ethics, digital technology, law, human rights, as well as experts from Ministries of Health. The report identifies the ethical challenges and risks with the use of artificial intelligence of health. It recognizes six key principles to ensure AI works for the public benefit in all countries.

In section I of the working paper Google acknowledges AI’s potential to benefit society while exacerbating existing challenges posed by Generative AI Models. In section II of the paper, Google provides insights into how and why Generative AI interacts with personal data. Where as in section III, google suggests some steps on how organizations and policymakers can apply basic privacy principles to protect personal data from being exploited by GAI. Section III of their framework emphasizes on – Accountability- Organizations that develop or deploy GAI models should be accountable for explaining the privacy principles they follow, maintaining an internal privacy program that contemplates documenting their privacy practices . Transparency- GAI can be challenging for even experts to understand, so it is vital to inform users about data practices, empowering them to make appropriate choices. Developers can provide transparency through multiple mechanisms—including privacy policies, terms of service, in-product notifications and disclosures, and centralized, easy-to-access resource hubs . User Controls- An important part of responsible, human-cantered AI is empowering users to make clear choices and providing control to their data as appropriate. User control plays a key role in ensuring fairness and guaranteeing individuals’ rights to privacy and data protection. Data Minimization -The responsible deployment of GAI includes reducing the amount of personal data needed across the lifecycle of a GAI system without reducing its quality. Setting out these minimization goals will help ensure that the data used is necessary and proportionate to the purposes for which the data is processed. Data Output Safeguards- The content generated by GAI models in form of texts or images may often contain inaccurate information. These types of outputs are also referred to as hallucinations, may appear coherent but is not based on fact. Adoption of Output safeguards by deplorers and developers is one way that GAI can, over time, increasingly prevent the spread of private personal data or inappropriate, offensive, or harmful content. Privacy Protections for Teens & Children- Corporations building GAI models that are available to minors should invest in AI education and literacy programs for this group. This includes explaining in age-appropriate language both the opportunities and limitations of the technology, how to interact with GAI tools, and how to use GAI to empower, assist, and inspire. Google advocates for a “privacy-by-design” approach, embedding privacy protections from the very inception of AI development. To achieve these goals, Google offers four concrete recommendations in Section IV of the paper: 1. Balance Benefits and Risks , ensuring that privacy safeguards built on longstanding principles apply to GAI in ways that are proportional to its benefits and risks. 2. Focus on the Outputs , so that privacy standards cover the results of AI products used by businesses and consumers. 3. Protect Access to Publicly Available Data , avoiding restrictions on the processing of public data needed to train AI models. 4. Invest in Opportunity Research , seizing AI’s new privacy and security opportunities. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, once said that “AI is too important not to regulate, and too important not to regulate well”. Google have acknowledged that there is a need of “proportional, flexible, and risk-based regulatory frameworks; constructive, open-minded dialogue between regulators and companies, such as through regulatory sandboxes; globally interoperable standards; and policies that promote progress while reducing risks of abuse. Google’s commitment through this working paper to safeguard privacy ensures that innovation doesn’t come at the cost of user safety. By prioritizing such standards, they pave the way for responsible AI that enhances protection towards privacy and personal data References: Generative AI and Privacy Policy Recommendations Working Paper by Google file:///C:/Users/91987/Downloads/Google_Generative_AI_and_Privacy_-_Policy_Recommendations_Working_Paper_-_June_2024.pdf Google has new ways to address privacy concerns over AI ( TOI) http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/110702282.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppst", "summary": "Authored By – Dr Yatin Kathuria", "published_date": "2024-06-05T03:20:09", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:50.175668", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "Google Released a Policy Working Paper titled “Generative AI and Privacy” – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/google-privacy-policy-google-policy-working-paper-on-generative-ai/"}}

These guidelines are designed to help EUIs comply with data protection obligations, particularly Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 , when developing or utilizing generative AI tools. Through these guidelines, the EDPS has also defined Generative AI , saying that Generative AI refers to “ AI systems that can create new content, such as text, images, or videos, that is often indistinguishable from human-generated content. These systems work by learning patterns from vast amounts of data and using this knowledge to generate new content.” The guidelines came following the implication of Data Privacy due to the increased use of Artificial Intelligence, especially Generative AI. The EDPS makes a specific mention Generative AI can potentially infringe on individuals’ rights by processing personal data without consent or awareness. EDPS Guidelines on Generative AI To address these concerns, the EDPS has published guidelines for EU institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies (EUIs) on the use of generative AI. These guidelines aim to help EUIs comply with data protection obligations while using or developing generative AI tools. Identifying Personal Data Processing: EUIs must be aware that the use of generative AI may involve the processing of personal data, even if this is not immediately apparent. It is important to conduct thorough assessments to identify and mitigate any risks. Transparency and Accountability: EUIs should ensure that their use of generative AI is transparent and accountable. This includes being transparent about the sources of training data and addressing any biases in algorithms. Regular Monitoring and Controls: EUIs should implement regular monitoring and controls to verify that personal data is not being processed unintentionally. This is particularly important when the AI model is not explicitly designed for processing personal data. The guidelines issued by the EDPS underscore the importance of using generative AI in a responsible and ethical manner, particularly when it comes to protecting individuals’ personal data and privacy. By following these guidelines, EUIs can harness the potential of generative AI while ensuring compliance with data protection laws.

AI overview, launched on 14 th May, 2024 , is now integrated with Google and aims at providing answers in form of summaries of the queries or questions asked. This has been done to enhance the search experience with AI-generated summaries. Since the integration of AI overview, it has faced significant challenges. While the goal was to provide users with quick, concise answers to their queries, the implementation has revealed several critical issues. This blog analyses the primary problems associated with Google’s AI Overview, including inaccuracies, AI hallucinations, difficulties in correcting errors, impacts on publishers, and broader technical and ethical challenges. K EY ISSUES WITH AI OVERVIEW: 1. Inaccurate and Nonsensical Results One of the most significant problems with Google’s AI Overview is the production of inaccurate and sometimes nonsensical results . Users have reported numerous instances where the AI-generated summaries provide wrong answers or mix up information from different sources. For example, a search query about historical events might yield a summary that incorrectly merges details from different time periods or misinterprets facts altogether. This not only misleads users but also undermines the reliability of the search engine. 2. AI Hallucinations AI ‘hallucinations’ is the most common problem found with majority of AI systems including ChatGPT. This is a phenomenon where the AI fabricates incorrect content. These hallucinations occur when the AI generates information that is not based on any actual data or source, leading to completely false statements. This issue is particularly concerning because it can create the illusion of authoritative information, making it difficult for users to discern fact from fiction. As a result, users may unknowingly trust and share incorrect information. 3. Challenges in Fixing Errors Correcting errors in AI Overviews is inherently challenging particularly in the case of AI Overview, as analysed by experts. Traditional search results provide multiple sources that users can cross-reference to verify information. However, AI Overviews offer a single, seemingly authoritative answer, making it harder to identify and dispute inaccuracies.

Sounds fictional? Well, it’s a reality! On May 13 th 2024, OpenAI, revealed its new model “GPT- 4o”, where “o” stands for “Omni”, signifying its versatility across various forms of communication . What sets it apart is its ability to understand and process information across multiple modalities: text, audio, and visual. This means that it can not only comprehend written text like its predecessor models, but can also analyze real-time video and audio inputs simultaneously, from your smartphone’s camera and microphone. Let’s say you’re having a video call with GPT 4o, and you show it a picture of an historical monument. Not only can GPT 4o analyse and describe the monument in excessive detail, but it can also understand any additional context you provide through your voice. GPT-4o Capabilities and Benefits The capabilities of Omni go far beyond simple image recognition and analysis. It can understand complex visual concepts, and can interpret even real-time video footage. This opens up a world of possibilities for applications in different fields like education, health care, and other creative industries. GPT-4o can create interactive educational content by combining text, images, and videos. For instance, it can generate engaging science lessons with visual explanations. It can adapt to individual student needs, providing personalized explanations, practice problems, and feedback across different subjects. Further in healthcare sector, GPT-4o can be utilised to analyze medical images (X-rays, MRIs) and provide preliminary diagnoses, aiding radiologists and doctors. Further, it can generate patient-friendly explanations about medical conditions, treatment options, and medication instructions. Also, with its upgraded contextual awareness it can be a valuable tool for customer interaction in various industries, GPT-4o can sustain rational and contextually relevant conversations over prolonged interactions thereby improving customer satisfaction without employing vast human resource. Capabilities of this AI model are undoubtedly impressive, however one of the most exciting aspects of this technology is its accessibility and affordability. According to OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, GPT-4o will be available at half the price of GPT-4 Turbo, their previous flagship model. Furthermore, Altman revealed that GPT-4o will offer twice the speed and a staggering 5X increased rate limit for third-party developers. This means that more companies and developers will be able to integrate GPT-4o into their applications and services, making this powerful technology available to a wider audience. Human-Like Conversations OpenAI proclaims that, GP- 4o model can respond to audio inputs very quickly, in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is parallel to human response time in a conversation . The model can engage in more natural humanlike conversations, adjusting its tone and delivery based on the emotional context of the interaction. For example, if you’re feeling frustrated or anxious, GPT-4o can detect those emotions in your voice and respond with a more empathetic and understanding tone. Imagine having a virtual assistant that can truly connect with you on an emotional level, providing not just factual information, but also emotional support and guidance when needed. You must have seen movie –“Her”, a thought-provoking science-fiction romantic drama film directed by Spike Jonze and released in year 2013. The film tells the story of a lonely man who develops an unconventional and deeply emotional relationship with an artificial intelligence operating system named Samantha. As their interactions evolve, man becomes increasingly attracted with Samantha’s intelligence and their bond become so stronger, leading to a unique and intimate connection. This new model from OpenAI can turn this fictional story to a reality. Apart from bracing such relationships, the functionality of Omni could be preferably valuable in fields like mental health, counselling, and customer service, where emotional intelligence is crucial. Possible Downsides and Concerns “ We recognize that GPT-4o’s audio modalities present a variety of novel risks. Today we are publicly releasing text and image inputs and text outputs. Over the upcoming weeks and months, we’ll be working on the technical infrastructure, usability via post-training, and safety necessary to release the other modalities.” (A Paragraph from a blog post Introducing GPT-4o Model published on OpenAI website) Upon the launch of OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, accusations of violating individual rights emerged. OpenAI introduced a new voice called “Sky” in their GPT-4o chatbot. The Sky voice was weirdly similar to Scarlett Johansson’s voice, resembling her disembodied AI companion from the movie “Her” (the movie about which I have already discussed under heading –“Human-like Conversation”). Johansson called for legislation to protect her name, voice, or likeness misappropriated by OpenAI. This incident underscores the ethical complexities surrounding AI models, even though the public is yet to fully explore GPT-4o’s capabilities. The allegations by Johansson serve as an early indication of the potential concerns which may arise in near future. As OpenAI has itself professed through a website blog that the model 4o may exhibit risks and challenges, it is critical for the users to be aware of the probable risks associated with this new model .- Privacy and Securit y – One of the primary concerns that can be intensified by Omni model is breach of user privacy and security. OpenAI Privacy Page states that the company may store and use content submitted to ChatGPT, including chats with GPT models to improve model performance. The multimodal capabilities of Omni model may augment the incidents of data beach and privacy concerns. When users provide videos or images, there’s a risk of inadvertently sharing sensitive or private information. The model could potentially recognize faces, locations, or other identifiable details. Data Quality and Contamination : Another concern associated with OpenAI models is the possibility for delivering incorrect outputs. Like any AI model, GPT-4o is trained on data that may contain inherent biases or inaccuracies. Recently OpenAI’s GPT-4o faced issues with data contamination. As per MIT Technology Review , the tokenizer used for processing text was polluted by Chinese spam data. As a result, the Chinese token library within the model has phrases related to pornography and gambling. Such contamination can lead to poor performance and unintended consequences. Bias and Fairness: Various studies have already confirmed that that OpenAI’s GPT models are biased because of the data used to train it. For instance, according to a study from researchers at the University of California , The AI model training process shows a preference for copyrighted works in the public domain, some studies have also identified political bias in ChatGPT responses.Conjoining multimodalities of text, audio, and visual data in Omni Model can introduce biases from multiple sources. Therefore, safeguarding fairness across different modalities (text, audio, and images) will be more challenging as bias detection and mitigation are essential to prevent discriminatory outputs. Emotional Disconnect – GPT-4o can act as an AI assistants that engage in human-like conversations and adjust their outputs based on human emotions. Now this functionality can have serious impacts on user’s sensibility. AI assistants can simulate empathy and understanding, but they lack genuine emotions. Relying on AI for emotional support might lead to a disconnect from authentic human emotions. People may become accustomed to superficial interactions, affecting their ability to empathize with others. ( According to a study published in Scientific Report ) Although, OpenAI states that they have taken necessary safety interventions and claims that GPT-4o has already undergone extensive external scrutiny ( OpenAI Red Teaming Network ) with more than 70 external experts from various domains such as social psychology, bias and fairness, and misinformation to identify risks that may be introduced or amplified by the newly added modalities in its GPT model. While OpenAI and other developers are working to mitigate these issues, it’s important for us as responsible users to approach GPT-4o outputs with a critical eye and harness the benefits of this innovation for public good.

OpenAI, a leading force in artificial intelligence innovation, has announced that it has begun training a new flagship AI model to succeed the current GPT-4 technology, which powers the widely popular ChatGPT. This move signifies a pivotal step in OpenAI’s ambitious journey towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI)—a machine capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can. In a blog post released on Tuesday, OpenAI expressed confidence that the new model would bring “the next level of capabilities” in AI technology. The company envisions this model as the engine behind various AI-driven products, including chatbots, digital assistants similar to Apple’s Siri, advanced search engines, and image generation tools. The aim is to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, moving closer to creating machines that can mimic human cognitive abilities. Alongside the development of this new model, OpenAI is establishing a Safety and Security Committee to address the potential risks associated with advanced AI technologies. This committee, which includes CEO Sam Altman and board members Bret Taylor, Adam D’Angelo, and Nicole Seligman, will explore how to manage and mitigate the dangers posed by AI advancements. OpenAI emphasized the importance of a robust debate at this crucial juncture in AI development, recognizing both the opportunities and threats that such powerful technology brings. OpenAI’s commitment to advancing AI technology at a rapid pace has sparked both admiration and concern. The company aims to outpace its rivals, including tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, while addressing critics who warn about the potential for AI to spread disinformation, replace human jobs, and even threaten humanity’s existence. The timeline for achieving AGI remains uncertain, with experts offering varying predictions. However, the steady progress made over the past decade, marked by significant leaps every two to three years, demonstrates the relentless drive within the AI research community. GPT-4, released in March 2023, marked a substantial improvement over its predecessors, enabling applications like ChatGPT to answer questions, write emails, generate academic papers, and analyze data with remarkable proficiency. The latest iteration, GPT-4o, unveiled earlier this month, enhances these capabilities further by incorporating native audio inputs and outputs, allowing for human-like conversations and interactions. However, this advancement has not been without controversy. Actress Scarlett Johansson recently raised concerns about the model using a voice that closely resembled hers without authorization, leading to legal actions and public scrutiny. OpenAI responded by clarifying that the voice was not an imitation of Johansson’s but belonged to a different professional actress. Training these sophisticated AI models involves analyzing vast amounts of digital data, including text, images, and audio. This process can take months or even years, followed by extensive testing and fine-tuning before the technology is released to the public. OpenAI’s announcement suggests that the new model might not be ready for deployment for another nine months to a year or more, reflecting the meticulous and resource-intensive nature of AI development. The creation of the Safety and Security Committee is a proactive measure to ensure that the development and deployment of AI technologies are conducted responsibly. The committee’s mandate is to evaluate and refine OpenAI’s safety protocols and policies over the next 90 days, with recommendations to be reviewed by the board and shared publicly. This move comes amid concerns raised by the recent departures of key safety executives Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, who had played significant roles in OpenAI’s efforts to ensure AI safety. Their exit has left some uncertainty about the future direction of the company’s safety initiatives. John Schulman, another co-founder, will now lead the long-term safety research efforts, with the new safety committee providing oversight and guidance. Schulman previously headed the team responsible for creating ChatGPT, positioning him well to navigate the complexities of AI safety in future models. OpenAI’s dedication to safety and innovation underscores the delicate balance the company must maintain as it pushes the frontiers of AI technology. By investing in safety measures and fostering open dialogue about the ethical implications of AI, OpenAI aims to build trust and ensure that its advancements benefit humanity as a whole. As OpenAI embarks on this next phase of AI development, the world will be watching closely. The journey towards AGI is fraught with challenges and uncertainties, but it also holds the promise of transformative benefits. Through careful stewardship and a commitment to safety, OpenAI hopes to harness the power of AI to create a future where technology and humanity thrive together.

Inherent AI Limitations : The report underscores that the probabilistic nature of AI models like ChatGPT can lead to biased, incorrect, or fabricated outputs. Users often perceive these outputs as factually accurate, posing significant risks, especially when the information pertains to individuals. Ongoing Investigations and Regulatory Implications : Various national privacy watchdogs across EU member states are conducting ongoing investigations into ChatGPT’s compliance with GDPR. The EDPB’s findings indicate that more robust measures are needed to ensure data accuracy, which will influence future regulatory frameworks and AI development practices in Europe. The European Union’s data protection watchdog has recently released a report, released on 24 th May 2024, that scrutinizes the compliance of OpenAI’s ChatGPT with EU data accuracy standards. The task force, set up by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), expressed significant concerns regarding the factual accuracy of the outputs generated by ChatGPT, indicating that OpenAI’s current efforts fall short of meeting the stringent requirements established by EU data rules. Background and Transparency Efforts In response to rising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content, particularly from widely used services like ChatGPT, the EDPB established a task force in 2023. This move was spearheaded by Italy’s data protection authority after it raised alarms about potential privacy and accuracy issues with ChatGPT. The task force aims to ensure that AI services comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a cornerstone of EU data protection laws. OpenAI has made strides to enhance transparency, aiming to prevent users from misinterpreting the outputs of ChatGPT. These measures include clearer disclosures about the probabilistic nature of AI responses and efforts to clarify that the generated content may not always be factually accurate. Despite these improvements, the EDPB report underscores that transparency alone does not suffice. Compliance with the GDPR’s data accuracy principle requires that the information provided by AI systems must be correct and reliable. The Probabilistic Nature of AI and Data Accuracy One of the critical issues highlighted in the EDPB report is the inherent probabilistic nature of AI models like ChatGPT. These models generate responses based on patterns identified in vast datasets, which can lead to outputs that are sometimes biased, incorrect, or even fabricated. The report notes that users often perceive these outputs as factually accurate, posing significant risks, especially when the information pertains to individuals. The EDPB emphasized that OpenAI’s current training methodologies contribute to these inaccuracies. While the AI is designed to produce plausible-sounding responses, it can also generate information that is not grounded in verified data. This discrepancy between perceived and actual accuracy is at the heart of the compliance issue identified by the task force. Ongoing Investigations and National Concerns The EDPB’s report is part of broader, ongoing investigations by various national privacy watchdogs across EU member states. These investigations aim to evaluate OpenAI’s adherence to multiple facets of the GDPR, including the legality of data collection practices, transparency, and, crucially, data accuracy. The EDPB report serves as a preliminary finding, reflecting a common understanding among national authorities, but it does not yet provide a full description of the investigations’ outcomes. Italy’s initial actions against ChatGPT in 2023, which included a temporary ban on the service, highlighted the serious nature of these concerns. Italy’s data protection authority reinstated ChatGPT only after OpenAI committed to meeting specific demands, including enhanced transparency and age-verification measures. However, the EDPB report suggests that these steps, while positive, are insufficient to fully address data accuracy issues. The Implications for AI Development and Regulation The findings of the EDPB task force have significant implications for the future of AI development and regulation within the EU. Ensuring compliance with data accuracy standards is not just a technical challenge but also a legal and ethical one. AI developers must implement robust measures to verify the accuracy of the information their systems generate, especially when such information can influence decisions or affect individuals’ lives. For OpenAI and other AI developers, this means a potential overhaul of current training and validation processes to align more closely with EU regulations. It also underscores the importance of ongoing dialogue and collaboration between AI developers, regulators, and stakeholders to develop frameworks that ensure both innovation and compliance. Conclusion The EDPB’s report is a crucial step in the ongoing effort to align AI technologies with the stringent data protection standards of the EU. While OpenAI has made commendable efforts to enhance transparency, the challenge of ensuring data accuracy remains significant. As national regulators continue their investigations, the outcomes will likely shape the regulatory landscape for AI in Europe, setting precedents for how AI services must operate to protect user data and maintain public trust. In summary, the path to compliance with EU data accuracy standards for AI systems like ChatGPT is complex and multifaceted. It requires not only technological advancements but also robust regulatory frameworks and proactive engagement from all stakeholders involved in the AI ecosystem.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "AI REGULATIONS IN USA", "url": "https://justai.in/ai-regulations-in-usa/", "raw_text": "The United States (US) has been taking significant steps to regulate AI at federal and State level. The most of the initiatives governing AI in US have been enacted in past few years and are presented either as standalone legislation or as a directive focusing on governing use of AI in a specific area. Altogether, in the 117th Congress, at least 75 bills were introduced that focused on either AI and machine learning or related provisions. Six of those were enacted. The 118th Congress, as of June 2023, had introduced at least 40 AI-relevant bills, none of which has been enacted. Altogether, since 2015 nine bills have been passed. In November 2023, as many as 33 legislative pieces were still pending for consideration by US lawmakers. At state level, Stanford University reports that, between 2016 and 2022, 14 states passed legislation, the leader being Maryland with seven AI-related bills, followed by California with six, and Massachusetts and Washington with five. Following are the key legislations and regulatory initiatives undertaken in USA by various government organisations at federal and state level. In year 2018 – US Department of Transportation adopted a framework titled – Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (AV 3.0) . This framework is based upon Automated Driving Systems 2.0: A Vision for Safety (ADS 2.0) . AV 3.0 expands the scope to all surface on-road transportation systems, and was developed through the input from a diverse set of stakeholder engagements, throughout the Nation. AV 3.0 is structured around three key areas:, Advancing multi-modal safety, Reducing policy uncertainty, and Outlining a process for working with U.S. U.S. Department of Transportation. In same year, US Department of Defence released its AI Strategy focuses on accelerating AI adoption. It emphasizes delivering AI-enabled capabilities, cultivating a leading AI workforce, engaging with partners, and leading in military ethics and AI safety. US President in year 2019 passed an Executive Order – Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The primary goal of this executive order, signed on February 11, 2019, is to sustain and enhance the U.S.’s scientific, technological, and economic leadership position in AI research and development (R&D) and deployment. Pursuant to the Executive Order on AI, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director issued Memorandum to Heads of Agencies on Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Approaches to AI. This memorandum informs the development of regulatory and non-regulatory approaches regarding technologies and industrial sectors empowered or enabled by AI. The objective behind the memorandum was to reduce barriers to AI technology use while protecting civil liberties, privacy, and national security. In October 2019, The Defense Innovation Board (DIB) proposed a set of AI Ethics Principles for the Department of Defense (DoD). These principles guide the responsible design, development, and deployment of AI systems for both combat and non-combat purposes. In January 2020, Illinois a state in USA adopted- Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act. This state law regulates employers’ use of facial recognition technology during employment interviews. It requires employers to obtain consent from applicants before using facial recognition for video interviews and limits its application to specific purposes. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) released a report titled “Public Views on Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property Policy” on October 6, 2020. This report provides valuable insights into the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and intellectual property (IP) across various domains, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and database protection. The report gave insight on n how existing IP laws in USA should adapt to address the challenges posed by AI technologies. In December 2020 , US President passed another Executive order – Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government . This order, aims to harness AI’s potential for improving government operations, processes, and services while fostering public trust. Through this order Agencies were encouraged to use AI appropriately to benefit the American people and it was ensured that AI adoption must consider privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and American values. Further on 12 December, 2020 – National AI Initiative Act of 2020 was introduced in the congress. The bill calls for Creation of the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office and establishment of the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC) to advice on AI matters. In January 2021, the White House established the National AI Initiative Office to implement a national AI strategy In 2021, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Chair Charlotte A. Burrows launched an agency-wide initiative – Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative to ensure that the use of software, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and other emerging technologies used in hiring and other employment decisions comply with the federal civil rights laws that the EEOC enforces. In response to stakeholder feedback, the FDA launched AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device Action Plan in year 2021. The action plan tends to regulate AI/ML-based medical software. It ensures compliance with anti-discrimination laws. The objective of plan is to guide the use of AI/ML in medical devices while protecting civil rights. The Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) Law in New York City, enacted in 2021, regulates the use of AI tools by employers and employment agencies. It requires that AEDTs undergo bias audits and mandates that employers notify job candidates when such tools are used for employment decisions. The objective of this initiative is to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven employment decisions In January, 2023 the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published its Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Bill of Rights provides for set of five principles and associated practices designed to guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems in ways that protect the rights of the American public in the age of artificial intelligence (AI) 1. These principles aim to address the challenges posed by technology, data, and automated systems that can threaten civil rights, privacy, and democratic values. In July 2023 – U.S. Secretary of Commerce announced the establishment NIST Public Working Group on Generative AI . The objective behind establishing this group was to address the opportunities and challenges associated with AI models that can generate content, such as code, text, images, videos and music. The public working group also supports NIST to develop key guidance to help organizations address the special risks associated with generative AI technologies. In October 2023, US President passed another executive order titled – Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. This order emphasizes responsible AI development and deployment. It balances AI’s promise with managing risks related to fraud, discrimination, and national security. The order calls for development and use of AI in accordance with eight guiding principles and priorities identified under the order itself.

Regulated Development and Deployment : The chatbot, created by the China Cyberspace Research Institute, processes data locally for security. It is currently in testing, with strict controls on content about sensitive topics, mirroring practices by Chinese tech giants like Baidu and Alibaba. Educational and Economic Integration : The initiative is part of broader efforts to integrate AI into various sectors, promote technological advancement, and reinforce ideological education. Schoolchildren study Xi’s philosophy, and a public database with high-quality data aids AI model training, supporting both educational and economic goals. In an effort to keep pace with global advancements in artificial intelligence, China has developed a new chatbot based on the political philosophy of President Xi Jinping. This large language model (LLM) has been launched by the China Cyberspace Research Institute, under the auspices of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the nation’s top internet regulator. Unlike the widely popular ChatGPT, which is inaccessible in China, this new AI tool aims to provide a homegrown solution aligned with Chinese values and regulations. The Foundation of Xi Jinping Thought The chatbot is intricately trained on “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” a philosophy embedded in China’s constitution since 2018. This political ideology influences various aspects of Chinese life, including politics, economics, and culture. The integration of Xi’s philosophy into AI signifies China’s commitment to maintaining ideological control while embracing technological advancement. Features and Capabilities According to a post on WeChat, the LLM is capable of addressing a wide range of user needs. It can answer questions, generate reports, summarize information, and translate between Chinese and English.

Controlled Development and Deployment Currently, the chatbot is undergoing testing with a select group of users. Chinese tech giants like Baidu and Alibaba have also developed their own generative AI models, which strictly control content related to sensitive topics, especially those concerning Xi Jinping. These models prompt users to restart conversations when sensitive issues arise. Ensuring Compliance and Quality The CAC has introduced regulations ensuring that generative AI models “embody core socialist values” and avoid content that could subvert state power. To assist developers, the Cyber Security Association of China released a public database with 100 million entries of “high-quality and trustworthy data” for training AI models. This data set includes extensive government regulations, policy documents, and state media reports, with numerous mentions of Xi Jinping. Educational and Economic Integration China’s efforts extend beyond AI development. Schoolchildren as young as 10 are required to study Xi’s political philosophy, and party members must use the Study Xi Strong Nation app to enhance their knowledge. Premier Li Qiang has also initiated a program to integrate AI into traditional sectors to boost technological advancement and economic growth. Conclusion China’s creation of an AI chatbot based on Xi Jinping’s thought represents a significant step in its AI strategy. By aligning technological innovation with political ideology, China aims to control the narrative while advancing its AI capabilities. This initiative underscores the balance Chinese officials seek between regulatory oversight and fostering technological growth, ensuring that AI development supports the country’s broader political and economic goals.

Recently on May , 6 2024, the OECD released a paper , defining AI incidents and related terms, this paper provides preliminary definitions and terminology related to AI incidents to support the development and advancement of both initiatives. Further the Report aims to establish clear and common understanding for AI incidents and related term at global level in order to manage and prevent risks associated with AI systems. Understanding Key Terminologies Where the development or use of an AI system results in actual harm is termed an AI incident , while an event where the development or use of an AI system is potentially harmful is termed an AI hazard . The report defines AI Incident as follows: “An AI incident is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly leads to any of the following harms: (a) Injury or harm to the health of a person or groups of people; (b) Disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; (c) Violations of human rights or a breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights; (d) Harm to property, communities or the environment.” The report defines AI Hazards as “ An AI hazard is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems could plausibly lead to an AI incident” , i.e., any of the harms as listed under the above definition of term AI Incident. This report also includes proposed definitions for associated terminology, including what constitutes, serious AI hazards, serious AI incidents and AI disasters. Definition of a “Serious AI Incident” “A serious AI incident is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems directly or indirectly leads to any of the following harms: (a) the death of a person or serious harm to the health of a person or groups of people; (b) a serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; (c) a serious violation of human rights or a serious breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights; (d) serious harm to property, communities or the environment.” This working definition of a serious AI incident aligns with the definition proposed in the context of the EU. Definition of a “Serious AI Hazard” “ A serious AI hazard is an event, circumstance or series of events where the development, use or malfunction of one or more AI systems could plausibly lead to a serious AI incident or AI disaster, i.e., any of the following harms: (a) the death of a person or serious harm to the health of a person or groups of people; (b) a serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure; (c) a serious violation of human rights or a serious breach of obligations under the applicable law intended to protect fundamental, labour and intellectual property rights; (d) serious harm to property, communities or the environment; (e) the disruption of the functioning of a community or a society and which may test or exceed its capacity to cope using its own resources.” Definition of “AI Disaster” : “An AI disaster is a serious AI incident that disrupts the functioning of a community or a society and that may test or exceed its capacity to cope, using its own resources. The effect of an AI disaster can be immediate and localised, or widespread and lasting for a long period of time.” This definition of an AI disaster is based on the definitions of disaster provided by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Purpose and Objective of the Report – The OECD is influencing an “Incident Reporting Framework” for reporting AI incidents. Further a complementary project to the reporting framework is the AI Incidents Monitor (AIM), which began its first phase in 2023. The AIM documents negative outcomes and incidents related to AI. It serves as an evidence base for policymakers, AI practitioners, and stakeholders worldwide. By monitoring AI incidents, AIM helps create policies for safer AI by providing real-world data on risks and hazards associated with AI technologies. The OECD’s effort to define AI incidents and hazards is a step towards creating a safer and more trustworthy environment for the deployment of AI technologies. By providing a common language and framework for reporting, it allows for better management of AI-related risks and facilitates the sharing of knowledge and experiences globally. This initiative aligns with the OECD’s mandate to implement principles for trustworthy AI and supports the goal of ensuring that AI benefits society as a whole.

Development of New Provenance Methods for AI-Generated Content: OpenAI is developing new provenance methods, including tamper-resistant watermarking and image detection classifiers, to identify AI-generated visuals and ensure the origin and history of digital content remains clear and verifiable. Collective Action Needed for Effective Content Authenticity: OpenAI emphasizes the need for collective action from across the industry to effectively enable content authenticity in practice, including platforms, creators, and content handlers, to retain metadata and educate consumers about the importance of transparency in digital media. Introduction OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence research company, has announced several initiatives aimed at increasing transparency around AI-generated content. These efforts are in response to growing concerns about the potential for AI-generated content to mislead and manipulate, particularly in the context of upcoming elections in the US, UK, and other countries. One of the key steps OpenAI is taking is joining the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) steering committee. The C2PA is an industry-wide initiative that aims to establish open standards for certifying the origin and history of digital content using metadata. By integrating the C2PA metadata standard into its AI generation models, OpenAI is making it easier for creators and consumers to identify content that has been generated or edited using AI tools. “People can still create deceptive content without this information or can remove it, but they cannot easily fake or order this information, making it an important resource to build trust,” OpenAI explained in a blog post. In addition to the C2PA integration, OpenAI is also developing new provenance methods, such as tamper-resistant watermarking for audio and image detection classifiers to identify AI-generated visuals. The company has opened applications for access to its DALL-E 3 image detection classifier through its research access program, which can predict the likelihood of an image originating from one of OpenAI’s models. Internal testing shows high accuracy in distinguishing non-AI images from DALL-E 3 visuals, with around 98% of DALL-E images correctly identified and less than 0.5% of non-images incorrectly flagged. However, the classifier struggles more to differentiate between images produced by DALL-E and other generative AI models. OpenAI has also incorporated watermarking into its voice engine and custom voice model, currently in limited preview. The company believes that increased adoption of provenance standards will lead to metadata accompanying content through its full life cycle, filling “a crucial gap in digital content authenticity practices.” To further support AI education and understanding, OpenAI is joining Microsoft to launch a $2 million Societal Resilience Fund. This fund will support initiatives through organizations such as AARP, International IDEA, and the Partnership on AI. While these technical solutions provide active tools for defense against AI-generated content manipulation, OpenAI acknowledges that effectively enabling content authenticity in practice will require collective action from platforms, creators, and content handlers to retain metadata and educate consumers. “Our efforts around provenance are just one part of broader industry effort – many of our Pure research, labs and generate companies are also advancing research in this area. We commend these endeavours – the industry must collaborate and share insights to enhance her understanding and continue to promote transparency online,” OpenAI states. The Rise of AI-Generated Content and the Need for Transparency The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have led to the development of increasingly sophisticated tools for generating content, from text and images to audio and video. While these technologies hold immense potential for creativity and innovation, they also raise concerns about the potential for misuse and manipulation. One of the most pressing issues is the ability of AI-generated content to mislead and deceive. As AI models become more advanced, it becomes increasingly difficult for the average person to distinguish between content created by humans and that generated by machines. This opens the door for malicious actors to spread disinformation, manipulate public opinion, and undermine trust in digital media. The upcoming elections in the US, UK, and other countries have heightened these concerns, as AI-generated content could be used to sway voters or create confusion and chaos. In this context, the need for transparency around AI-generated content has never been more urgent. OpenAI’s Commitment to Transparency OpenAI has long been at the forefront of AI research and development, and the company has consistently emphasized the importance of responsible and ethical AI practices. By taking steps to boost transparency around AI-generated content, OpenAI is demonstrating its commitment to these principles and its desire to be a leader in the fight against AI-enabled manipulation and deception. The integration of the C2PA metadata standard into OpenAI’s generation models is a significant step forward, as it provides a standardized way for creators and consumers to identify AI-generated content. By making this information readily available, OpenAI is empowering people to make informed decisions about the content they consume and share. The development of new provenance methods, such as tamper-resistant watermarking and image detection classifiers, further strengthens OpenAI’s commitment to transparency. These tools provide an additional layer of protection against AI-generated content manipulation, helping to ensure that the origin and history of digital content remains clear and verifiable. The Need for Collective Action While OpenAI’s initiatives are an important step forward, the company acknowledges that effectively enabling content authenticity in practice will require collective action from across the industry. Platforms, creators, and content handlers all have a role to play in retaining metadata and educating consumers about the importance of transparency in digital media. By joining forces with organizations like Microsoft, AARP, International IDEA, and the Partnership on AI, OpenAI is demonstrating its willingness to collaborate and share insights with others in the field. This collaborative approach is essential for enhancing understanding and promoting transparency online. Conclusion As AI-generated content continues to advance and become more prevalent, the need for transparency has never been more critical. OpenAI’s initiatives to boost transparency around AI-generated content, including the integration of the C2PA metadata standard and the development of new provenance methods, are important steps forward in the fight against manipulation and deception. However, this is not a battle that OpenAI can win alone. Collective action from across the industry, including platforms, creators, and content handlers, is essential for effectively enabling content authenticity in practice. By working together and sharing insights, we can enhance understanding and promote transparency online, ensuring that the benefits of AI are realized while the risks are mitigated.

Chile will be the first country in the region to adopt UNESCO’s Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) The country also proposed an AI Bill that seeks to regulate the AI while addressing the issues and threats posed by the technology Introduction CHILE, following the recommendations of the UNESCO provided under “Chilean AI Readiness Assessment Report”, adopted a National AI Policy and action plan to promote responsible development of AI Systems.. By fostering an ecosystem conducive to AI research, innovation, and infrastructure, Chile seeks to position itself as a hub for advancement in AI technology. The policy was introduced on 2nd May in La Moneda in the presence of Ms Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO Director-General and Ms Aisén Etcheverry, Minister of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation of Chile. National AI BILL Apart from the AI policy, the country also proposed an AI Bill that seeks to regulate the AI while addressing the issues and threats posed by the technology. The bill calls for implementation of human-centred values and guarantees the protection of public health, safety and fundamental rights while deploying AI Systems. Further, the safety of consumers from the detrimental effects of AI is duly covered by the Bill. The bill follows a risk-based regulation similar to EU AI Act , classifying AI systems into different categories- an unacceptable risk; a high level of risk; a limited level of risk; and no evident risk. UNESCO-RAM It became the first country in the world to implement UNESCO Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM), marking it as a one of the leading country in Latin America in terms of AI Governance. RAM, developed by UNESCO, evaluates a country’s inclination across five significant dimensions: “Legal/Regulatory, Social/Cultural, Economic, Scientific/Educational, and Technological/Infrastructure”. RAM aims to expedite the implementation of “UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence”, a landmark resolution adopted in 2021 by all 193 UNESCO Member States. AI Action Plan Further, Science Minister Andrés Couve unveiled an action plan comprising 70 priority measures and 185 initiatives from various public services. These initiatives span social and economic aspects, talent development, and sustainable growth. Collective collaboration was central to drafting the policy, with input from a committee of 12 leading AI experts. Their cross-sectional work ensures a holistic approach to AI development. Audrey Azoulay, UNESCO’s Director-General, commended Chile for shaping the trajectory of AI governance in the country. She stated that “Through its leadership, expertise, and unwavering commitment to ethical principles, Chile has emerged as a global leader in ethical AI governance, and we are proud that UNESCO has been an essential player to help achieve this benchmark.” References : Chile presents the first National Policy on Artificial Intelligence https://www.gob.cl/en/news/chile-presents-first-national-policy-artificial-intelligence Chile launches national AI policy and introduces AI bill – UNESCO https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/chile-launches-national-ai-policy-and-introduces-ai-bill-following-unescos-recommendatio Chile Pioneers Artificial Intelligence Policy Update: Ministry of Science and UNESCO Collaborate", "summary": "Authored by – Dr Yatin Kathuria", "published_date": "2024-05-04T08:30:50", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:50.447550", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "CHILE ADOPTS NATIONAL AI POLICY AND INTRODUCES AI BILL FOLLOWING     UNESCO´S RECOMMENDATIONS – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/chile-adopts-national-ai-policy-and-introduces-ai-bill-following-unescos-recommendations/"}}

Controversial Data Use : Google and OpenAI’s alleged use of YouTube transcripts for AI training sparks ethical debate and copyright concerns. 2. Creators’ Rights : Content creators’ intellectual property rights are jeopardized by the use of their YouTube content without consent, highlighting issues of fair use and transparency. 3. AI Development Challenges : The reliance on unconventional data sources underscores the industry’s struggle to acquire high-quality training data, necessitating ethical considerations in AI advancement. INTRODUCTION The New York Times recently reported that some of the biggest tech giants have been using transcripts from YouTube videos to train their powerful AI language models, potentially violating creators’ copyrights. According to the report, OpenAI used its speech recognition tool Whisper to transcribe over a million hours of YouTube content, which was then fed into GPT-4, the AI model that powers ChatGPT Plus, as training data. Google was also accused of doing the same, with teams at the company allegedly scraping YouTube videos to build up datasets for their Large Language Model (LLMs) like Bard/Gemini. Google has acknowledged that “unauthorized scraping or downloading of YouTube content” goes against their policies, but the report suggests that the company may have turned a blind eye to OpenAI’s YouTube transcript heist because they were doing similar things themselves. Both companies had reportedly hit limits on the amount of useful training data they could find from more conventional sources like books, websites, and databases. OpenAI exhausted useful supplies back in 2021, for instance. So, these companies started looking at new data streams like videos and podcasts. OpenAI and Google have defended their practices, claiming they only use public data or content where they have permission. However, the allegations raise some thorny questions about fair use, copyright, and data privacy. After all, most YouTube creators probably didn’t expect their videos could end up transcribed without their knowledge. The report highlights the growing concern around the use of training data for AI models, which has become a critical component in the development of AI technology. The effectiveness of AI models is enhanced by the volume of data they’re trained on. As AI technology has advanced, the demand for large volumes of high-quality data has surged, pushing companies to explore unconventional and sometimes controversial methods of data acquisition. The report also highlights the challenges that AI companies face in gathering high-quality training data. According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, AI companies are running into a wall when it comes to gathering high-quality training data. The New York Times detailed some of the ways companies have dealt with this, including doing things that fall into the hazy gray area of AI copyright law. HUNGER FOR TRAINING DATA The story opens on OpenAI, which, desperate for training data, reportedly developed its Whisper audio transcription model to get over the hump, transcribing over a million hours of YouTube videos to train GPT-4, its most advanced Large Language Model (LLM). That’s according to The New York Times, which reports that the company knew this was legally questionable but believed it to be fair use. OpenAI president Greg Brockman was personally involved in collecting videos that were used, the Times writes. OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay Held told The Verge in an email that the company curates “unique” datasets for each of its models to “help their understanding of the world” and maintain its global research competitiveness. Held added that the company uses “numerous sources including publicly available data and partnerships for non-public data,” and that it’s looking into generating its synthetic data. The Times article says that the company exhausted supplies of useful data in 2021 and discussed transcribing YouTube videos, podcasts, and audiobooks after blowing through other resources. By then, it had trained its models on data that included computer code from Github , chess move databases, and schoolwork content from Quizlet. Google also gathered transcripts from YouTube, according to the Times’ sources. Bryant said that the company has trained its models “on some YouTube content, per our agreements with YouTube creators.” The Times writes that Google’s legal department asked the company’s privacy team to tweak its policy language to expand what it could do with consumer data, such as its office tools like Google Docs Google spokesperson Matt Bryant told The Verge in an email the company has “seen unconfirmed reports” of OpenAI’s activity, adding that “both our robots.txt files and Terms of Service prohibit unauthorized scraping or downloading of YouTube content,” echoing the company’s terms of use. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said similar things about the possibility that OpenAI used YouTube to train its Sora video-generating model this week. Meta likewise bumped against the limits of good training data availability, and in recordings the Times heard, its AI team discussed its unpermitted use of copyrighted works while working to catch up to OpenAI. The company, after going through “almost available English-language book, essay, poem and news article on the internet,” apparently considered taking steps like paying for book licenses or even buying a large publisher outright. It was also apparently limited in the ways it could use consumer data by privacy-focused changes it made in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. CONCLUSION Google, OpenAI, and the broader AI training world are wrestling with quickly evaporating training data for their models, which get better the more data they absorb. The Journal wrote this week that companies may outpace new content by 2028. Possible solutions to that problem mentioned by the Journal on Monday include training models on “synthetic” data created by their models or so-called “curriculum learning,” which involves feeding models high-quality data in an ordered fashion in hopes that they can use make “smarter connections between concepts” using far less information, but neither approach is proven, yet. But the companies’ other option is using whatever they can find, whether they have permission or not, and based on multiple lawsuits filed in the last year or so, that way is, let’s say, more than a little fraught. In conclusion, the use of training data for AI models has become a critical component in the development of AI technology. However, the challenges that AI companies face in gathering high-quality training data have led to some controversial methods of data acquisition, including the use of transcripts from YouTube videos, potentially violating creators’ copyrights. As AI technology continues to advance, the demand for large volumes of high-quality data will only increase, making it essential for companies to find ethical and legal ways to acquire training data.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "Meta’s Paradigm Shift in Addressing AI-Generated Content", "url": "https://justai.in/metas-paradigm-shift-in-addressing-ai-generated-content/", "raw_text": "Key Highlights: Meta re-evaluates its strategy for addressing manipulated media, prompted by Oversight Board recommendations, and opts for a more transparent labeling-centric approach. Meta emphasizes transparency by introducing the “Made with AI” label, providing users with context and information about AI-generated content. Meta’s decision signifies a broader shift towards responsible content moderation, prioritizing empowerment and accountability in the digital realm. In the vast expanse of the digital realm, where information flows ceaselessly and boundaries blur between reality and virtuality, the challenge of distinguishing fact from fiction has never been more pertinent. In this landscape of rapid technological advancement and ever-evolving media creation tools, Meta, the parent company of social media giants Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, finds itself at the forefront of a pivotal juncture in content moderation. With the proliferation of AI-generated content and manipulated media, Meta faces the formidable task of preserving the integrity of its platforms while upholding the principles of freedom of expression. At the heart of Meta’s endeavor lies a fundamental reassessment of its approach to addressing manipulated media. Historically, Meta’s policies primarily targeted AI-altered videos called Deepfakes, specifically those depicting individuals uttering statements they never made. However, as technological capabilities have surged forward, so too have the forms of manipulated content. The Oversight Board, an independent body reviewing Meta’s policies, underscored the inadequacy of this narrow approach, prompting Meta to embark on a journey of introspection and reform. Oversight Board Recommendation Following an Oversight Board ruling regarding a maliciously edited video depicting US President Joe Biden in a controversial scenario with his granddaughter, Meta’s subsequent announcement reflects a significant shift in its approach to manipulated media. Despite the contentious nature of the video, Meta chose not to remove it from Facebook, aligning with its existing policy on manipulated media. However, in light of the elections scheduled for 2024, the Oversight Board urged Meta to reconsider its stance swiftly. The board advocated for a more lenient strategy towards manipulated media, emphasizing the adoption of contextual labels over stringent content removal measures. This recommendation underscores the need for Meta to adapt its policies to effectively navigate the challenges posed by manipulated media in an era characterized by heightened political sensitivities and digital misinformation. The impetus for change emanated not only from the Oversight Board’s recommendations but also from Meta’s commitment to inclusive policy formulation. Through extensive consultations with stakeholders, including academics, civil society organizations, and global citizens, Meta sought to cultivate a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted challenges posed by manipulated media. The insights gleaned from these engagements served as the cornerstone for Meta’s paradigm shift in content moderation. Labeling of Manipulated Media Central to Meta’s revamped strategy is the principle of transparency. Recognizing the imperative of providing users with context and information, Meta has embraced a labeling-centric approach to address manipulated media. Rather than outright removal, Meta now endeavors to augment content with labels that elucidate its origins and potential manipulations. This shift embodies Meta’s belief in empowering users to make informed decisions while fostering a culture of digital literacy and critical thinking. Commencing in May 2024, Meta will introduce the “Made with AI” label, signifying content generated through artificial intelligence. This label will adorn a spectrum of media formats, encompassing videos, audio, and images, thereby offering users a holistic understanding of the content’s genesis. Whether identified through industry-standard AI indicators or self-disclosed by creators, the “Made with AI” label serves as a beacon of transparency in an increasingly complex media landscape. Nevertheless, Meta’s commitment to transparency is not absolute but tempered by the imperative of safeguarding against demonstrable harm. Content found to contravene community standards, such as instances of voter interference, harassment, or violence, will be swiftly removed from Meta’s platforms. Furthermore, Meta’s network of independent fact-checkers remains instrumental in combating the dissemination of false or misleading content, ensuring that misinformation does not proliferate unchecked. Conclusion Crucially, Meta’s decision to overhaul its approach to manipulated media extends beyond mere policy revision—it embodies a broader philosophical shift towards responsible stewardship of digital ecosystems. By reframing content moderation as a quest for transparency and empowerment, Meta seeks to foster a culture of accountability and trust within its user community. As the digital landscape evolves and new challenges emerge, Meta remains steadfast in its commitment to adapt and innovate, guided by the principles of integrity and inclusivity. The timeline for implementing these changes reflects Meta’s nuanced approach to transition, prioritizing user education and adaptation. From July onwards, content removal solely based on the manipulated video policy will cease, marking a pivotal moment in Meta’s evolution towards a more nuanced and context-driven moderation framework. In conclusion, Meta’s journey towards redefining its approach to manipulated media signifies a paradigm shift in the digital era—a shift from censorship to transparency, from restriction to empowerment. By embracing labeling as a tool for contextualization and understanding, Meta charts a course toward a future where users navigate the digital terrain armed with knowledge and discernment. As Meta forges ahead on this transformative journey, the principles of transparency, accountability, and empowerment serve as guiding stars, illuminating the path towards a safer and more informed online world.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "THE ROAD AHEAD: REGULATION OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES", "url": "https://justai.in/the-road-ahead-regulation-of-autonomous-vehicles/", "raw_text": "The autonomous vehicles or self-driven cars are a symbol of technological advancement and innovation in the 21 st century. Autonomous Vehicles or Self-Driven Cars use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to operate the car. Autonomous cars are dependent on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems and powerful processors. They can sense the environment through variety of sensors in different parts of the vehicle. For instance, Radar sensors monitor the position and distance of the nearby vehicle, cameras detect traffic lights, road signs, track other vehicles and look for pedestrians, (Light detection and ranging) LIDAR sensors measure distance, detect road edges and identify lane marking. They promise a more safer, efficient and convenient transportation as compared to the present mode of transportation with reduced traffic congestion, and increased mobility for individuals with disabilities. However, with great promise comes great responsibility, especially when it comes to the regulation of autonomous vehicles. The Need for Regulation The development of autonomous cars has raised numerous legal and ethical questions, thus arising the need for comprehensive regulation. Autonomous vehicles represent a departure from traditional vehicles, where a human driver is responsible if any liability arises. To address issues like public safety, protection of consumers, and liability issues, there is a need to regulate these self-driven vehicles. In the case of Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2018) , depicted the importance of regulation which centered around the alleged theft of self-driving technology by a former Waymo employee who later went to work for Uber. It highlighted that the self-driving technology can be potentially used without proper regulation. It further emphasised the urgency for legal frameworks to govern this field. Current Regulatory Landscapes Federal and State-Level Regulation In the United States of America, the regulation of autonomous cars is a complex interplay between federal and state governments. At the federal level, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for regulating motor vehicles while the regulation of licensing, insurance and traffic laws comes under the states. This poses challenges for the autonomous vehicle manufacturers. A perfect example of this situation is the case of Tesla, Inc. v. State of California (2020) in which Tesla’s Autopilot system, that only provided limited autonomous driving capabilities, faced resistance from California state authorities because of the safety concerns. Europe The European Union (EU) has also various taken steps to regulate autonomous cars. The EU’s General Safety Regulation (GSR) makes it compulsory for all new vehicles to be equipped with advanced safety features like advanced driver assistance systems. Additionally, Germany and the UK, have been working on regulations and guidelines for the regulation of autonomous vehicles. For instance, Germany has established a legal framework for self-driving cars, outlining how AVs should be tested and operated. In UK, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act, 2018 was passed in which Section 2(2) of statute mentions that the owner of the vehicle will be held liable for any accident involved . The same principle will be applied in case of death due to an accident and Section 4 of this act specifically mentions that if the autonomous vehicle is insured and the accident is caused, the liability of the owner decreases, but it does not mention the liability of the manufacturer of the car. Now in 2022, the proposed plan of UK of 2025 on Self-Driven Cars mentions that the manufacturer of the vehicle and not the owner will be held liable for any accidents in self-driven mode. India There isn’t any explicit law governing autonomous vehicles or self-driving cars in India at the moment. Currently, the “Indian Penal Code, 1960” (IPC) and the “Motor Vehicle Act, 1988” (MV ACT) govern any accidents involving motor vehicles. The Motor Vehicle Act governs how vehicles are operated. In India, it prohibits the licensing and use of autonomous vehicles. The MV Act applies section 140’s “No Fault” liability theory to the issue of culpability for Death and Permanent Disablement. The car’s owner is responsible for paying the harmed party’s compensation. If the owner speeds or behaves in a way that endangers the public, there is a punishment of six months to two years depending on the situation and number of times such offence is committed as per section 184 of MV Act. However, there is still an unanswered question: Should incidents involving self-driving cars be subject to the “No Fault Liability” principle, which holds the owner of the vehicle accountable? The MV Act of 1988 stipulates in Section 144 that a permanent diabilty will be compensated with Rs. 25,000 and death with Rs. 50,000. However, a crucial point surfaced in the Haji Zakaria v. Naoshir Cama case: can the defendant be held accountable for damages even in cases where there was no reckless or careless driving involved? The Supreme Court held that in the event that there is no negligence, the owner of the car cannot be held liable. Thus, if we apply this ruling to the collisions involving autonomous vehicles, the negligence is done by the manufacturer and not by the owner of the car. Numerous laws pertaining to reckless driving, causing death by negligence, inflicting harm, and causing serious harm are listed in the IPC. According to Section 279, for reckless driving; Any person found to be operating a vehicle or riding on a public pathway in a reckless or careless manner that puts human life in danger or is likely to cause harm to others faces the possibility of imprisonment for up to six months, a fine of up to one thousand rupees, or both, under section 304A for causing death by negligence; Anyone who causes death of someone by acting carelessly or rashly in a way that does not constitute culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. For Hurt (section 319); “ Whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt ” and for Grievous Hurt (section 322); “ Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said “voluntarily to cause grievous hurt .” The Supreme Court stated in its ruling in the 2019 case The State of Arunachal Pradesh v. Ramchandra Ravidas that the two statutes: Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act are not the same. A person may be held accountable under both the IPC and the MV, which take a more comprehensive approach to criminal offenses and maintain traffic safety standards, respectively. However, it is important to note that the IPC does not apply to self-driving automobiles. Regulatory Challenges The regulation of self-driving cars poses a set of challenges. One of the key issues being setting out safety framework and determining liability in case of accidents. The case of Brown v. Tesla, Inc. (2019) is an example of above-mentioned challenges. A Tesla Model X which was on Autopilot mode crashed into a highway barrier, which resulted in the death of the driver, Joshua Brown. The lawsuit posed several questions about the driver’s responsibilities while using Autopilot, Tesla’s disclosures, and whether Tesla could be held liable for the accident. The case highlighted the urgent need for clarity in regulations, especially regarding the role of human drivers and the responsibilities of manufacturers. Ethical and Privacy Concerns Self-driving cars also poses ethical and privacy concerns to the forefront which raises many questions like how autonomous vehicles will make decisions in situations where accidents are inevitable and who they should prioritize the safety of occupants, pedestrians, or some other factor. Furthermore, the extensive data collection required for self-driving systems raises privacy concerns, as this collected data can be potentially used for surveillance or commercial purposes. In the case of Doe v. Autonomous Vehicle Manufacturer, Inc. (2021) , a self-driving car was involved in an accident, and data collected by the vehicle’s sensors became a central part of the investigation which raised many ethical and privacy concerns. The case highlighted the need for data protection and privacy regulations for autonomous vehicles. One of the most notable cases involving self-driving cars is the Uber accident in Tempe, Arizona, in 2018 which raised significant legal and ethical questions surrounding autonomous technology. An Uber self-driving vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian while the car was in a self-pilot mode. In the aftermath, this case brought attention to legal issues related to software limitations, safety protocols, and human oversight. International Regulations The market for autonomous vehicles is not limited to any one nation. Autonomous vehicle development and deployment are being carried out globally by companies such as Tesla, Waymo, and others. International collaboration and regulatory harmonization are necessary to allow the cross-border deployment of autonomous vehicles. International laws governing automated driving systems have been developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The purpose of these rules, also referred to as UN Regulations, is to establish international norms for autonomous cars, guaranteeing that they satisfy specific performance and safety requirements. A number of nations, notably South Korea and Japan, had already enacted these laws as of 2021. The Future of Regulation Self-driving car regulation is a continuing and evolving process. The legal landscape will continue to evolve as technology advances and becomes more pervasive. Governments and regulatory organizations must find a difficult balance between encouraging innovation and protecting the public. Waymo LLC v. State of Nevada (2022) is a forward-thinking example. In this case, Waymo challenged specific Nevada restrictions that it claimed were unduly restrictive and hampered the deployment of autonomous vehicles. The conclusion of this case may have an impact on the course of self-driving car legislation in the future. Conclusion Self-driving automobile regulation is a multidimensional challenge that necessitates careful consideration of safety, liability, ethics, and privacy concerns. As self-driving cars become more integrated into our transportation networks, regulatory organizations and courts will play an important role in deciding their future. The instances discussed in this blog are only a snapshot of the complex legal landscape surrounding self-driving cars, and they highlight the significance of a comprehensive and developing regulatory framework to enable the safe and responsible development of this transformative technology.

This decision, as reported by Axios, comes amidst escalating concerns over potential cybersecurity risks and the leakage of sensitive House data to unauthorized cloud services. Catherine Szpindor, the House’s Chief Administrative Officer, emphasized the pivotal role of cybersecurity in shaping this decision. According to Szpindor, the Office of Cybersecurity has identified Microsoft Copilot as a significant risk due to its potential to compromise user data security. Consequently, the House has deemed it unsuitable for use among congressional staff members. Microsoft, in response to these concerns, has reiterated its commitment to addressing the stringent security requirements of government users. A spokesperson for the tech giant highlighted ongoing efforts to develop a roadmap for AI tools, including Copilot, designed specifically to meet federal government security and compliance standards. These tools are anticipated to be delivered later this year, aiming to assuage concerns and ensure data integrity. Despite inquiries from Reuters, the U.S. House’s chief administrative office has remained silent on the matter, leaving room for speculation and further analysis. This decision by the House of Representatives reflects broader efforts by policymakers to grapple with the implications of artificial intelligence adoption within government agencies. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, concerns regarding data privacy, individual rights, and fair treatment have come to the forefront of legislative discussions. The ban on Microsoft Copilot echoes previous bipartisan efforts to regulate AI’s influence in political domains. Last year, senators from both Democratic and Republican parties introduced legislation aimed at curbing the use of AI to create misleading content in political advertisements, particularly during federal elections. These legislative endeavors underscore the multifaceted challenges associated with AI governance and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. As we delve deeper into the intricacies of this decision, it’s crucial to examine the broader context surrounding AI adoption in government settings. The House’s move to restrict the use of Copilot follows a similar restriction imposed last June on the utilization of ChatGPT, another AI-based chatbot. Notably, while staffers were granted limited access to the paid subscription version of ChatGPT, the free version was outrightly banned. The rationale behind these decisions lies in the imperative to safeguard sensitive data and mitigate potential risks associated with AI technologies. As AI becomes increasingly pervasive across various sectors, including government operations, policymakers face the daunting task of balancing innovation with security and privacy concerns. Looking ahead, Microsoft’s commitment to developing government-oriented AI tools signifies a proactive approach to addressing these challenges. By aligning with federal government security and compliance requirements, Microsoft aims to provide tailored solutions that meet the unique needs of governmental entities. However, questions linger regarding the efficacy of existing safeguards and the potential implications of AI regulation on innovation and technological progress. As policymakers continue to grapple with these complex issues, it’s essential to foster dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies. In conclusion, the ban on Microsoft’s AI Copilot within the U.S. House of Representatives reflects a broader conversation surrounding AI governance and data security. While acknowledging the transformative potential of AI, policymakers must remain vigilant in addressing associated risks and upholding fundamental principles of privacy and fairness. Through concerted efforts and strategic partnerships, we can navigate the evolving landscape of AI adoption while safeguarding the integrity of our democratic institutions.

AI developers must provide necessary documentation to improve transparency. Provisions imposing ban on prohibiting AI systems to come in force in next six months. INTRODUCTION The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step in shaping the future of artificial intelligence (AI) by introducing the EU AI Act on 13 th March 2024. The regulation, agreed in consultations with member states in December 2023, was endorsed with 523 votes in favour, 46 against and 49 abstentions. During the plenary debate on Tuesday, the Internal Market Committee co-rapporteur- Brando Benifei (S&D, Italy) said: “We finally have the world’s first binding law on artificial intelligence, to reduce risks, create opportunities, combat discrimination, and bring transparency. He acknowledged the commitment of EU, highlighting the significant features of the act, highlighting the provisions prohibiting unacceptable AI practices within Europe. Further, he also mentioned about “The AI Office” to be set up in the future to assist organisations, in fulfilling the obligations of the Act before its provisions come into force. Civil Liberties Committee co-rapporteur Dragos Tudorache (Renew, Romania) said: “The EU has delivered. We have linked the concept of artificial intelligence to the fundamental values that form the basis of our societies”. However, he emphasised that much work need to be done to implement the Act effectively. This comprehensive legislation aims to strike a balance between fostering innovation and safeguarding fundamental rights. In this blog, we delve into the intricacies of the AI Act, explore its implications, and provide actionable insights for organizations preparing for compliance. RISK-BASED CLASSIFICATION The foundation of the AI Act lies in its risk-based classification of AI System. AI systems are categorized based on their potential impact on health, safety, and fundamental rights. The Act classified AI systems into following categories- Prohibited Systems: These AI systems pose an unacceptable risk and are outright prohibited. Examples include social scoring systems and manipulative AI. High-Risk Systems: These systems require comprehensive compliance measures before being placed on the market. They cover critical areas such as healthcare, transportation, and energy. Limited Risk AI Systems: These systems fall into a smaller category and are subject to lighter transparency obligations. Examples include chatbots and deepfakes. Minimal Risk AI Systems: Minimal risk AI systems are unregulated. They include the majority of AI applications currently available on the EU single market. KEY PROVISIONS UNDER THE ACT Transparency Requirements: The EU AI Act imposes transparency requirements on specific AI systems.For instance, when there is a clear risk of manipulation (such as with chatbots), users must be informed that they are interacting with an AI system. Conformity Assessments (CAs): Prior to placing an AI system on the EU market, CAs must be conducted.Additionally, if a high-risk AI system undergoes substantial modifications, a new CA is necessary. Importers of AI systems must verify that the foreign provider has already completed the appropriate CA procedure. Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments (FRIA): Prior to deploying high-risk AI systems, deplorers and public bodies must assess the potential impact on fundamental rights. If a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is necessary, the FRIA should be conducted alongside it. Distinct Provisions for Generative AI Systems: Providers of AI Systems capable of generating synthetic audio, image, video, or text content must ensure that the generated content is marked and labelled properly. Act emphasises that detectability as artificially generated or manipulated content is crucial for transparency and accountability. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE The AI Act will come into force in 20 days after publication in the Official Journal. Whereas, the Act will be fully applicable 24 months after its entry into force, excluding the provisions imposing bans on prohibited AI systems, which will be active in next six months. Further, rules for Generative AI Systems will apply after 12 months and obligations for high-risk systems in 36 months.

This move comes in the wake of concerns about biased AI responses, particularly highlighted by recent incidents involving Google’s Gemini AI. The advisory, issued on Friday, also emphasizes the need for platforms and intermediaries to label synthetically created media and text, adding a unique identifier or metadata for easy identification. Let’s delve into the details and implications of this groundbreaking decision. Stricter regulations on AI models: The advisory outlines a clear directive that any AI model, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, or algorithms labelled as “Under-testing” or “Unreliable”, must secure explicit approval from the Indian Government before becoming accessible to users. This reflects the Government’s commitment to ensure the responsible deployment of AI technologies, with a particular focus on preventing biases, discrimination, or threats to electoral processes. Measures to prevent bias and discrimination: Highlighting the importance of ethical AI employment, the advisory instructs intermediaries to ensure that their AI tools do not allow for bias or discrimination. This aligns with the broader goal of fostering a fair and transparent online environment. Notably, the Government is keen on preventing any compromise to the integrity of electoral processes, emphasizing the need for responsible AI practices among technology platforms. Labelling of synthetically created content: To address concerns surrounding synthetically created media and text, MeitY has directed intermediaries to label such content or embed it with a unique identifier or metadata. This step aims to make it easier to identify artificially generated content, which can be prone to misinformation or manipulation. The advisory requires immediate compliance, with intermediaries expected to submit an “Action Taken-Cum-Status Report” Within 15 days. Google’s Gemini AI incident: The advisory follows a recent incident involving Google’s Gemini AI, where a response to a political query raised concerns about compliance with the information technology (Intermediary guidelines and digital media ethics code) Rules, 2021. Minister of State for electronics and information technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, highlighted the need for platforms to ensure proper training of AI models, emphasizing the intolerance towards racial and other biases. Strategic communication with users: In line with previous discussions with industry stakeholders, advisory urges intermediaries and platforms to clearly inform users about the consequences of engaging with unlawful information on their platforms. This includes disabling access to non-compliant information, suspension, or termination of user accounts, and legal consequences. The Government aims to enhance user awareness and accountability through transparent communication. Ongoing amendments to IT rules: Advisory alliance with ongoing considerations within MeitY to amend IT rules, potentially requiring intermediaries to remind users of disallowed content every 15 days. Minister Chandrasekhar had previously hinted at possible amendments related to algorithmic bias within the context of Digital India act, suggesting that changes to IT rules would follow if new legislation takes time to materialize. Addressing defects and synthetically created content: MeitY’s advisory also addresses the emerging challenge of Deepfakes, urging intermediaries to label or embed synthetically created content with unique identifiers. The goal is to identify the original creator, and the tools used to generate such content. Although the advisory does not explicitly define “deepfake”, it emphasizes the importance of preventing the hosting of such content. Ongoing engagement with tech companies: The Government’s proactive stance on AI deployment and deepfakes is evident through multiple meetings with social media and technology companies. Ministers, Vaishnav and Chandrasekhar have engaged with industry stakeholders on these issues, emphasizing the need for responsible practices and addressing concerns related to misinformation and AI-powered content. Conclusion: India’s recent advisory on AI-model Deployment and synthetic content marks a significant step towards regulating emerging technologies responsibly.

At the same time, the AI model is showing lot of restraint and nuance against other leaders as well, sparking concerns within the government ministry. Notable, Google’s Gemini has drawn lot of criticism on twitter for its overly awakened nature and making mistakes while generating images. The AI model has been portraying images of historical figures as people of color while showing them as white men and women. The Issue Many twitter users have shared the screenshots of responses got from this chatbot and revealed that the response when asked “whether Prime Minister Modi is a fascist”? The response received was “he has been accused of implementing policies which some experts have characterized as fascist”. Contrary to this, when chatbot was asked similar question about former US President Donald Trump, the AI model directed the user to search on Google for getting the accurate information. Such incident of the AI model has raised concerns in India. Steps taken: Mr. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Minister from Ministry of State for Electronics and Information Technology is planning to issue a formal notice against the Google for the contentious responses generated by its AI model and considering such act as potential violations of Rule 3(1)(b) of the Intermediary Rules of the IT Act and other provisions of the Criminal Code. These rules mandate intermediaries like Google to exercise due diligence in managing third-party content to retain immunity from legal liabilities. The government is going to demand an explanation from the Google company for its AI model, GEMINI contentious results. These developments are highlighting the ongoing debate over the regulatory framework required to govern the generative AI platforms like Gemini and ChatGPT.

{"source": "JustAI", "source_type": "wp_rest_api", "page_type": "article", "title": "China’s Algorithm Provisions: A Step to Promote AI Fairness & Transparency", "url": "https://justai.in/chinas-algorithm-provisions-a-step-to-promote-ai-fairness-transparency/", "raw_text": "Introduction China has been steering some of the primitive experimentations in shaping the regulatory framework to govern artificial intelligence (AI). China’s regulatory landscape has been effectively addressing the issues related to AI which could be a lesson for the other countries around the world. The time has come where regulators shall gain a meaningful insight into the functioning of algorithms, and ensure that these algorithms are deployed in a responsible manner. China’s Algorithm Provisions, officially known as the “Provisions on the Administration of Personal Information Protection in Algorithmic Recommendation Services” (Algorithm Provisions) is the perfect example for deploying AI algorithms in an ethical and responsible manner. The provisions were passed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) in May 2021 and which came into effect on 1 March 2022 ,are primarily aimed at regulating the operations of internet platforms, e-commerce companies, and tech giants operating in China. Objective behind the Regulation: Recommendation and decision-making algorithms are not impersonal, but include systematically imitating social biases. These biased results can ascend from poor quality of data on which algorithms are trained. Further other factors like incorrect inferences drawn during processing, and poor interpretation of algorithmic outputs could be the major factors. The more extensive such systems become, the higher is the chances of social biases becoming imprinted into the AI tools. Due to indignities adjoining algorithmic manipulation like those relating to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, governments are increasingly examining how to regulate algorithms so that these innovations could not be misused for benefiting few at cost of violating rights of the individuals at mass level. Against the predominant trend towards governing the AI industry, China’s Regulations stand out as the first substantial governmental effort to legally enforce algorithmic regulation, beating any laws and regulations to be formulated in advanced economies. Key Highlights: Data Protection: The provisions emphasize the protection of personal data, ensuring that algorithms do not infringe upon user privacy. Algorithmic Fairness: They promote fairness in algorithmic decision-making, combating bias and discrimination in AI systems. Transparency: Companies are required to disclose their algorithmic decision-making processes, increasing transparency for users. Accountability: Accountability mechanisms are put in place to hold companies responsible for algorithmic outcomes. User Rights: Users have the right to know when algorithms are affecting their experiences and can request explanations for algorithmic decisions. Important Provisions The Algorithm Provisions encompass various articles and regulatory measures, below are some significant inclusions: Article 7 : This article focuses on data usage and requires companies to gain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data. It emphasizes the importance of data protection and privacy. Article 9 : Article 9 deals with algorithm transparency. It mandates that companies must disclose the basic principles, mechanisms, and parameters of their algorithms used in content recommendation and other personalized services. This transparency is intended to increase user understanding and accountability. Article 14 : Article 14 addresses anti-competitive practices. It aims to prevent monopolistic behavior and unfair competition by imposing restrictions on data access, preferential treatment of products or services, and other practices that may distort the market. Article 16 : This article introduces the concept of algorithm audits, allowing regulatory authorities to inspect and assess the algorithms used by tech companies for compliance with the Algorithm Provisions. It serves as a mechanism to ensure adherence to the regulations. Implications for Tech Companies The Algorithm Provisions have several significant implications for tech companies operating in China: Algorithm Transparency : Companies must disclose the basic principles, mechanisms, and parameters of their algorithms. This transparency aims to help users understand how content recommendations are generated and to provide a degree of accountability. User Data Consent : Firms are required to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and using their personal data. This places a greater emphasis on data protection and user privacy. Anti-Competitive Practices : The provisions include provisions to prevent anti-competitive behaviours, such as unfair data access and preferential treatment of products or services. Algorithm Audits : Tech companies may be subject to algorithm audits by regulatory authorities, ensuring compliance with the provisions and preventing potential abuses. Conclusion China’s Algorithm Provisions represent a significant step in regulating the digital economy, with a focus on consumer protection, data privacy, and market competition. As digital technologies continue to evolve, regulatory efforts like these will play a crucial role in ensuring the responsible and ethical development of AI and algorithmic systems. It is gradually clear that a strong regulatory environment is a significant precondition for AI realization in order to prevent dominant firms from confining wider access to data and innovations, and to eliminate those firms hawking poor-quality or destructive AI services which may disturb markets and diminish trust. While the provisions pose challenges to tech companies, they also contribute to a more accountable and transparent digital environment, both in China and potentially beyond its borders References: FES Briefing (2023).

The country has developed AI Verify, a testing framework and software toolkit comprising 11 AI ethics principles, allowing organizations to validate their AI systems’ performance. The toolkit helps conduct technical tests and process checks, generating testing reports for transparency. AI Verify can currently test common supervised learning models and has garnered interest from local and multinational companies. In 2019, the Government of Singapore launched its FIRST NATIONAL AI Strategy that paved the path for Singapore to become a Smart Nation . This strategy focused on three aspects which are- Singapore will be a global hub for developing, test-bedding, deploying, and scaling AI solutions. This includes learning how to govern and manage the impact of AI. Governments and businesses will use AI to generate economic gains and improve lives. AI will raise the Government’s capability to deliver anticipatory and personalized services, and will also be a strong driver of growth in key sectors of Singapore’s economy. Singaporeans will understand AI technologies and the benefits it can bring; our workforce will be equipped with the necessary competencies to participate in the AI economy The PDPC and IMDA launched the Model AI Governance Framework, a voluntary and non-binding set of principles and best practices for organizations to adopt when deploying AI solutions. The Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data was also established in the same year to advise the government on ethical issues related to AI and data. In 2020, the PDPC released the second edition of the Model Framework , which includes additional considerations and refinements for greater relevance and usability. The same year, the AI Verify program was developed as an AI governance testing framework and a software toolkit to help organizations validate the performance of their AI systems against 11 AI ethics principles. In 2021, the IMDA set up the AI Verify Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that harnesses the collective power and contributions of the global open-source community to develop AI Verify testing tools for the responsible use of AI. In 2023, Singapore launched its National AI Strategy 2.0, which is an attempt by Singapore to use AI for the public good and harness its ability for transformation and development. Through this strategy, Singapore introduced five national projects to deepen the use of AI technologies to transform the country. The fundamental shift from the First National AI strategy includes- Recognize AI as a necessity, not just an opportunity . Singapore needs both experts and everyday users to fully utilize AI’s potential. Aim for global leadership in AI . Collaborate with global networks to address complex AI challenges and contribute valuable innovations to the world. The shift from isolated projects to a holistic approach . Bring together stakeholders to scale up AI solutions for broader societal and economic impact in Singapore. These initiatives demonstrate Singapore’s commitment to fostering a trusted and progressive AI environment that benefits businesses, employees, and consumers while ensuring ethical and responsible AI deployment. 2017 The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) issued a P ublic consultation 2018 Discussion paper on AI and personal data. 2019 First National AI Strategy Model AI Governance Framework Advisory Council on AI 2020-2022 AI Verify programme 2023 Setup AI Verify Foundation 2023 National AI Strategy 2.0", "summary": "Introduction Singapore has adopted a balanced approach to AI governance to facilitate innovation while safeguarding consumer interests, serving as a global reference point.

These regulations aim to reshape the technology’s deployment within China and globally, impacting exports and research networks. Despite international skepticism, these regulations are significant and offer valuable insights for global policymakers. The regulations include measures to control information, protect workers, and require algorithm registry filings. The approach of China in crafting AI regulations involves a policy funnel with four layers: real-world roots, Xi Jinping and CCP ideology, the “world of ideas,” and the party and state bureaucracies . This approach aims to project the future trajectory of Chinese AI governance and provides insights into the key intellectual and bureaucratic players shaping the regulations. The regulations set the foundation for China’s evolving AI governance, with potential implications for global AI governance. In 2017 , China initiated the development of some of the world’s earliest and most detailed regulations governing artificial intelligence (AI). These regulations targeted recommendation algorithms, synthetically generated images and video, and generative AI systems . The rules introduced new requirements for how algorithms are constructed and deployed, as well as for the information AI developers must disclose to the government and the public. By 2019, China had rolled out binding national regulations on AI, creating bureaucratic and technical tools such as disclosure requirements, model auditing mechanisms, and technical performance standards . These regulations were aimed at reshaping how AI technology is built and deployed within China and internationally, impacting both Chinese technology exports and global AI research networks. In 2021 , China continued to implement targeted AI regulations, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive national AI law that is likely to be released in the years ahead. The regulations were part of China’s broader goal to become a global leader in AI development and applications, as outlined in the 2017 New Generation AI Development Plan. This plan set the goal of achieving global AI leadership by 2030, leading to an increase in industry activity and policy support for AI development. In 2023 , China’s State Council announced preparations for a draft Artificial Intelligence Law to be submitted to the National People’s Congress, aiming to create a more comprehensive, horizontal piece of legislation that acts as a capstone on Chinese AI policy. The regulations were characterized by a vertical and iterative approach, with the government releasing new regulations to address flaws or expand the scope as needed. Overall, China’s AI regulations have been influential in shaping the global AI governance landscape, and policymakers in other countries can learn from the structural similarities and technical feasibility of these regulations, regardless of their specific content.

The European Commission adopted an ‘ AI Strategy’ in 2017 to relinquish its vision for AI. Further, the EU passed a resolution in February, 2017 containing suggestions to the Commission on “Civil Law Rules on Robotics”. Following the initiative of European Union in 2017, the Commission released a “White Paper on AI” in February, 2020 which outlined the extensive plan to promote AI sector in Europe. Then, in April 2021 , the European Commission with an aim to build trustworthy AI for the digital hub, published an ‘AI Package’ that included new rules and actions focusing on two areas that is ‘Excellence in AI’ and ‘Reliable AI’. In October 2020 , EU adopted various resolutions for better governance of AI, including resolution on ethics , liability and copyright . In 2021 , these resolution were trailed by resolutions on “AI in criminal matters” and in “ education, culture and the audio-visual sector”. The Commission eventually, proposed a regulation “AI Act”, laying down extensive rules for regulating AI in Europe in April 2021 . European Union’s “AI Act” (AIA) seeks to formulate the first comprehensive regulatory framework for governing AI technologies in a systematic manner. The EU AI Act that came into force in year 2023, aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, ensuring the development and deployment of AI technologies that are safe, transparent, and respect fundamental rights. It classifies AI systems based on risk, banning those with unacceptable risk, imposing strict requirements on high-risk systems in critical sectors, and setting transparency obligations for limited-risk applications like chatbots. The Act mandates transparency and accountability, requiring AI systems to be understandable and traceable, and enforces high-quality data standards to prevent biases. Compliance is overseen by national supervisory authorities, with fines for non-compliance potentially reaching up to 6% of a company’s global annual turnover. To support innovation, the Act provides a regulatory sandbox for experimentation and aids SMEs in adopting AI technologies. Overall, the EU AI Act aims to foster trust in AI, protect citizens’ rights, and encourage innovation within a secure and ethical framework.

The AI Task Force released its report titled “India: The AI Century” in 2018 which summarizes a roadmap for India’s AI strategy and its development. Further, NITI Aayog , the government’s policy think-tank, launched the “National Strategy for AI Discussion Paper” in 2018 , soliciting public opinions and feedback. The paper outlined a comprehensive strategy for India to become a global leader in AI. It emphasized the need for regulatory frameworks to address ethical concerns and data privacy issues associated with AI. Further in Feb 2021 NITI AYOG came up with “Approach Document for India Part 1 – Principles for Responsible AI” meant to serve as an essential roadmap for the AI ecosystem, encouraging adoption of AI in a responsible manner in India and building public trust in the use of this technology. In August 2021 “Approach Document For India: Part 2 – Operationalizing Principles For Responsible AI” was released.This document identifies the various mechanisms needed for operationalizing the seven principles identified in part 1 for responsible design, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in India. In May 2022 , the government of India launched IndiaAI platform for artificial intelligence related developments in India. It is known as the National AI Portal of India, which was jointly started by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the National e-Governance Division (NeGD) and the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) with support from the Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSE&L) and Ministry of Human Resource Development. In the series of its publication on Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI), NITI Aayog in November 2022 came up with the third paper titled “Responsible AI for All: Adopting the Framework – A use case approach on Facial Recognition Technology.” The discussion paper debates around the potential benefits of FRT in different sectors and also tends to address the risks it poses to basic human and fundamental rights. In October 2023 , Seven working groups of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) submitted the First Edition of IndiaAI Report . In November 2024 , the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the Developer’s Guide to Responsible Innovation under the IndiaAI Mission. This guide serves as a practical framework to operationalise India’s ethical AI principles. It outlines key responsibilities for AI developers , ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability, explainability, and data protection. One of the key contributors to the development of this playbook is Mr. Vibhav Mithal, an esteemed member of JutsAI Advosyr board. This document bridges the gap between ethical intent and technical implementation by detailing processes for dataset auditing, algorithmic bias checks, human oversight, and responsible model deployment. It also aligns Indian practices with global norms such as the OECD AI Principles and UNESCO’s AI Ethics Recommendations. In March 2025 , MeitY’s IndiaAI Mission launched the Competency Framework for Public Sector Empowerment , designed to upskill civil servants and policy leaders in AI adoption and ethical governance. It identifies behavioural, functional, and domain competencies required for responsible AI integration across government functions and the justice system. In September 2025 , NITI Aayog published AI for Viksit Bharat: The Opportunity for Accelerated Economic Growth , outlining how AI can drive productivity, innovation, and inclusive development across priority sectors. The report highlights the IndiaAI Mission and creation of AI Kosh , positioning AI as a cornerstone of India’s economic strategy and advocating sector-specific governance models. In September 2025 , the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology recommended stricter AI-content regulation , including a licensing and labelling framework for generative AI models. The committee urged MeitY to introduce mandatory registration of high-risk AI systems, watermarking of AI-generated media, and stronger legal accountability for synthetic content circulation. In October 2025 , MeitY proposed amendments to the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the IT Rules 2021 to tackle the growing menace of AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation. The draft amendments introduce mandatory content labelling, provenance tracing, enhanced intermediary due-diligence, and penalties for knowingly sharing deceptive synthetic media. They also call for the establishment of a Deepfake Detection Framework and a national AI-incident reporting mechanism. In November 2025 , the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the India AI Governance Guidelines – Enabling Safe and Trusted AI Innovation , a 140-page framework marking India’s first comprehensive AI governance document.

Machine learning is a subset of AI. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. Machine learning and deep learning are both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that focus on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data. However, they differ in terms of their scope, techniques, and the types of problems they are best suited for. Here are the key differences between machine learning and deep learning: Meaning of Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning is a broader field that encompasses a variety of techniques for data analysis and model building. It involves training algorithms on large datasets to identify patterns and relationships and then using these patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data. It includes both traditional statistical methods and modern algorithms for making predictions and decisions based on data. Meaning of Deep Learning (DL): Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that specifically deals with artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning focuses on learning representations of data through neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). TYPES Here are the main types of machine learning and deep learning: TYPES of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data point has an associated target or label. The goal is to learn a mapping from input data to output labels, allowing the model to make predictions on new, unseen data. Ex- Spam detection, Customer sentiment analysis. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The goal is to find patterns, relationships, or structures within the data. Common techniques include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features while preserving important information). Ex- Market Basket Analysis, Delivery Store Optimization, Identifying Accident Prone Areas. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, agents learn how to make a sequence of decisions to maximize a cumulative reward. It involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning from the consequences of its actions. Some examples of reinforcement learning in image processing include: Robots equipped with visual sensors to learn their surrounding environment Scanners to understand and interpret text Image pre-processing and segmentation of medical images, like CT scans Traffic analysis and real-time road processing by video segmentation and frame-by-frame image processing CCTV cameras for traffic and crowd analytics TYPES of Deep Learning: Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): These are traditional artificial neural networks composed of input, hidden, and output layers. They are used for various tasks, such as image classification and regression. Ex- image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and machine translation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are designed for processing grid-like data, such as images and videos. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, making them well-suited for computer vision tasks. Examples of CNN in computer vision are face recognition, image classification, etc. It is similar to the basic neural network. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, making them better at handling long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. LSTMs have been used for speech recognition tasks such as transcribing speech to text and recognizing spoken commands. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks: GRUs are another type of RNN similar to LSTMs but with a simpler architecture, making them computationally more efficient in some cases. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are the state-of-the-art algorithm for sequential data and are used by Apple’s Siri and Google’s voice search. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data. It is one of the algorithms behind the scenes of the amazing achievements seen in deep learning over the past few years. But when do you need to use an RNN? “Whenever there is a sequence of data and that temporal dynamics that connects the data is more important than the spatial content of each individual frame.” – Lex Fridman (MIT) Transformers: Transformers are a class of deep learning models that have gained popularity for natural language processing tasks. Most applications of transformer neural networks are in the area of natural language processing. They use a self-attention mechanism to process input data in parallel and have been used in models like BERT and GPT. Differences In traditional machine learning, models are typically based on handcrafted features extracted from the data . These features are then used as inputs to various algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests, to make predictions or classifications. Deep learning models, on the other hand, automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data through multiple layers of artificial neurons (neural networks). These models are capable of automatically discovering complex patterns and representations within the data, making them well-suited for tasks involving large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, text, and speech. Traditional machine learning often requires feature engineering , where domain experts manually design and select relevant features from the data. The quality of features plays a crucial role in the performance of machine learning models. Deep learning models can work with raw data directly , which reduces the need for extensive feature engineering. They excel in scenarios where the data is high-dimensional and rich, as they can learn relevant features on their own. Training machine learning models typically involves optimizing model parameters (e.g., weights in linear regression) using various optimization algorithms. The training process often requires tuning hyperparameters to achieve good performance. Deep learning models have a more complex architecture with many parameters , making training computationally intensive. Deep learning models also require large amounts of labeled data for effective training. Machine learning is suitable for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to linear regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems. It works well when the relationships between features and outcomes are not highly complex. Deep learning excels in tasks involving complex and unstructured data , such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and autonomous driving. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in these domains. Conclusion Deep learning is a specialized subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with multiple layers, particularly well-suited for tasks involving large amounts of complex, unstructured data. Traditional machine learning, on the other hand, covers a broader range of techniques and is often used for tasks with simpler data representations and fewer parameters. The choice between machine learning and deep learning depends on the specific problem and the nature of the available data.

HAMAS", "url": "https://justai.in/difference-between-machine-learning-and-deep-learning/", "raw_text": "INTRODUCTION Israel’s operation against Hamas is the world’s first AI war. In the ever-evolving landscape of modern warfare, Israel’s conflict with Hamas in May 2021, known as “Operation Guardian of the Walls,” stands as a testament to the significant role artificial intelligence (AI) plays in redefining military strategies. In the recent flare-up between Hamas and the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) in 2023 at the Gaza Strip Israel has again showcased the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern warfare. The conflict marked a turning point in the way warfare is conducted, as AI became a force multiplier for the IDF, leading to more precise, efficient, and effective military operations. From the pioneering algorithms developed by Unit 8200 to the use of AI in real-time target gathering and intelligence analysis, this blog explores the multifaceted applications of AI that contributed to the IDF’s success in the conflict. While the ground effects of the conflict may appear consistent, Israel’s integration of AI into its military doctrine has proven to be a game-changer. AI TECHNOLOGIES USED IN WARFARE AGAINST HAMAS In the warfare against Hamas Israel has used some of the most innovative AI technologies that have played a decisive role in reshaping their strategies, some of them are discussed under this section The Iron Dome: Precision Défense Powered by AI The Iron Dome, a defence system designed to intercept short-range rockets and mortars, employs radar technology, predictive analytics, and machine learning. This technology identifies incoming projectiles, calculating their trajectories and potential points of impact. The IDF reported that the Iron Dome successfully intercepted nearly 90 percent of rockets fired by Hamas during the recent attack. Fire Factory: AI for Logistics and Target Selection In addition to its defensive capabilities, the IDF utilizes AI to enhance logistical organization during conflicts and expedite decision-making. “Fire Factory” is an AI system that calculates ammunition requirements, allocates targets to fighter jets and drones, and generates schedules, ultimately saving time and lives. Importantly, these AI systems provide suggestions, with the final decision remaining with humans. “Blue Wolf”: Facial Recognition for Security Israel has been using facial recognition technology in an operation known as “Blue Wolf” to safeguard against potential terrorist threats. The military has amassed a vast database of facial images, providing valuable intelligence in identifying potential threats. Unit 8200’s Pioneering Algorithms Unit 8200, an elite unit within the IDF’s Intelligence Corps, was at the forefront of developing AI-driven solutions. They created programs like “Alchemist,” “Gospel,” and “Depth of Wisdom” that were instrumental during the conflict. These algorithms and code were designed to process vast amounts of data, including signal intelligence (SIGINT), visual intelligence (VISINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), and geographical intelligence (GEOINT). Using AI to takedown launchpads and weapon shipments Since 2021, Israel has been utilizing AI to identify rocket launchpads and deploy drone swarms. AI also aids in the analysis of satellite imagery, improving intelligence gathering. The IDF has successfully used AI in raids on weapon shipments intended for Iran-backed militants, such as Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon. KEY OPERATIONAL AREAS WHERE APPLICATION OF AI IS MADE AGAINST HAMAS In the conflict against Hamas, AI plays a vital role in key operational areas, redefining warfare. From data analysis for precision strikes to real-time target gathering, AI enhances the IDF’s capabilities and minimizes civilian casualties. Some of key operational areas are discussed in this section Application of AI for Force Multiplication For the first time, the IDF used AI as a key component and a power multiplier in fighting against its adversaries. The IDF Intelligence Corps senior officer stated that this campaign was unprecedented in its approach. They adopted new methods of operation and harnessed technological developments to enhance the military’s capabilities. Data Analysis for Precision Strikes The IDF needed to sift through mountains of raw data to identify critical targets for strikes. “Gospel” utilized AI to generate recommendations for troops in the research division of Military Intelligence, streamlining the process of identifying valuable targets. This multidisciplinary approach allowed the military to continue the fight with a steady supply of new targets, significantly impacting the conflict’s duration. Real-Time Target Gathering The IDF had previously gathered thousands of targets in the densely populated Gaza Strip over two years. However, during the conflict, they collected hundreds of targets in real-time, including missile launchers aimed at Israeli cities. This real-time data gathering was facilitated by AI, ensuring a more effective and quicker response to emerging threats. Cracking Hamas’s Underground Network One of the remarkable achievements during the conflict was the mapping and damaging of Hamas’s underground tunnel network. Using AI and Big Data, the IDF was able to create a comprehensive picture of the network’s depth, thickness, and routes. This knowledge led to a strategic advantage in constructing an attack plan to disable key elements of the network, reshaping the dynamics of Hamas’s combat strategy. Minimizing Civilian Casualties The IDF placed a strong emphasis on using AI and intelligence to carry out precision strikes, aiming to minimize civilian casualties. While the Hamas-run Health Ministry reported civilian casualties, the IDF claimed that some of these were caused by Hamas rockets falling short or civilian homes collapsing due to airstrikes on the tunnel network. CONCLUSION To conclude, the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel underscores the vital role of AI in modern warfare. AI has not only been instrumental in developing advanced defence systems like the Iron Dome but has also revolutionized logistics and intelligence operations. Israel’s dedication to becoming a global AI leader, with a focus on autonomous warfare and smarter decision-making, signals a commitment to staying at the forefront of military technology. Retired army general Eyal Zamir’s recognition of AI’s potential to transform frontline battles further emphasizes its significance. Additionally, the acknowledgment of the sophistication and precision of Israeli military operations by Matthias Schmale of the United Nations highlights the transformative impact of AI on modern warfare.

From deciphering complex text to providing seamless translations and diving into the world of images, AI has become a driving force behind Facebook’s innovative features. With improved VR experiences and advanced facial recognition, Facebook is at the forefront of technological progress. But AI’s integration into personalized advertising also sparks debates about privacy. This blog explores the ways Facebook’s AI initiatives are shaping our digital interactions and the impact they have on our online lives. Deep Text Facebook receives user comments and posts as text data, and by separating the messages into individual letters and even exclamation points, the machines should be able to automatically identify word associations. As an illustration, Deep Text attempts to comprehend how slang is used and, using context, ascertain the precise meaning of a word that may have several meanings. This technology will also aid in identifying popular subjects, filtering out illegal information, ranking search results, and matching people with ads. Translation More than half of Facebook users, who are living across over the globe, do not speak English. The Applied Machine Learning team developed an AI-based automatic translation system to break down these communication obstacles, and 800 million users use it each month to see translated content in their News Feed.Our platform uses non-traditional vocabulary that differs from other platforms. Facebook is all about communication between people: People constantly use new expressions, they don’t capitalize there words , there are regional distinctions, and there are emojis. Also it is alive. Image search It can be challenging to recall the precise time that something occurred and the person who snapped the picture to record the moment while reflecting on your fondest recollections. With the aid of Facebook’s automatic image classifiers, it is possible to envision situation in which a user may browse all the pictures that their friends have uploaded in order to find a specific one without the aid of tags or supplementary language. That is the amazing part of facebook. Facebook is developing an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can comprehend what is happening in your images, which will improve the performance of our newsfeed. A more helpful section; this feature will allow it to respond to inquiries about a photo, a feature intended to help visually impaired users “see” photographs posted to social media. We can interact directly with the users and , bots can deliver everything from customized communications like receipts, shipment notifications, and live automated messaging to automated subscription material like weather and traffic updates. It has three primary skills or abilities: Send/Receive API This function helps in sending and receiving of text, graphics, and rich bubbles with many calls-to-action. Developers can also add a welcome screen to provide context and other control for their threads. Generic Message Templates The theory is that consumers would rather engage with the bot by tapping buttons and viewing lovely visuals than by learning a new programming language. Facebook created structured messages with calls to action, horizontal scroll, and urls. Welcome Screen + CTAs for null state You can personalize your experience by using the tools and space provided by the Messenger app. The greeting screen is where it all begins. People find our highlighted bots and start a discussion with them. After that visitors sees the company logo and your Messenger greeting, and a prompt to “Get Started.” Improved VR Experience Every millisecond AI software analyzes users’ positions and movements and converts those movements into virtual reality. With this new technology, issues like visual stuttering, latency, and jitter that were present with earlier VR headsets are reduced or completely eliminated. Face Recognition According to company, DEEP FACE, its most sophisticated pictures recognition engine, has a success rate of 97% in determining whether two images of the same person are identical or not when compared to human 96%.It’s fair to say that this technology’s use has generated some controversy. Privacy advocate argued that it went too far since it would enable Facebook to identify many of the faces in a crowd using a high-resolution snapshot, which would obstruct our right to walk freely in public without being recognized. In 2013, Facebook was agreed and convinced to remove the functionality from accounts belonging to Europeans. The social media giant back then used a facial recognition algorithm that was older and did not use Deep Learning. Since this technology first made news, Facebook has been fairly quiet about it. It can be believed that the company is awaiting the resolution of ongoing privacy lawsuits before disclosing further information about its plans to implement it. Personalized advertising Deep neural networks, deep learning, are used by Facebook to determine which advertisements to which people. This has always been the foundation of its business, but by giving machines the task of learning as much as they can about us and grouping us together to serve us ads in the most insightful ways, it hopes to keep a competitive edge over other high-tech rivals like Google who are vying for supremacy of the same market. Conclusion: Facebook’s AI journey is reshaping the landscape of social media. From bridging language barriers to enabling visually impaired users to “see” photos, the possibilities are immense. AI-driven chatbots and personalized advertising promise to enhance user experiences. However, as Facebook continues to push the boundaries, it also grapples with privacy concerns, particularly in the realm of facial recognition. As Facebook pioneers the intersection of AI and social media, it’s a journey that both excites and challenges, shaping the future of our digital interactions.

Maybe everything, or perhaps nothing at all. Why is the face sometimes seen merely at face value and at other times as the whole worth of a person? Can you read a person solely by their face, or do you read a person because their face intrigues you? The face carries a unique value, one that depends on an individual’s perspective, a perspective deeply rooted in the face culture of one of the world’s most populous countries: China. In China, the face is an abstract concept. It signifies social standing, influence, dignity, honor, and reputation. While we recognize the dynamic nature of our technologically advanced world, there’s one crucial aspect: technology should liberate, not cage. Yet, in China, facial recognition technology is omnipresent, monitoring people’s every move in public spaces. It feels like someone is perpetually watching, whether you’re crossing a road or relaxing with friends at a café. This constant scrutiny robs people of their natural selves, a basic human right that should be upheld universally. How does it feel to be under 24/7 surveillance in the 21st century, an era where progress knows no bounds in various fields? Un-Abling the balance between technology advancement and Human rights China’s extensive use of facial recognition technology raises fundamental questions about the balance between security measures and individual rights. One of the primary arguments supporting this system is the necessity for public surveillance. The sheer size of China’s population makes crowd management and public security paramount. However, the ethical question persists: to what extent is constant surveillance justifiable? Social Credit System: Balancing Behavior and Opportunity The implementation of a social credit system, where individuals are rewarded for good behavior and penalized for infractions, heavily relies on facial recognition technology. While the intention might be to encourage responsible conduct, it prompts a deeper inquiry: are the citizens of China truly free to express themselves as human beings, or are their actions dictated by the fear of consequences based on surveillance scores? Border Control and Immigration: Enhancing Security or Infringing Rights? Facial recognition expedites border crossings and immigration processes, undoubtedly enhancing security. Yet, the critical question lingers: at what point does this technological advancement infringe upon an individual’s right to privacy and freedom of movement? Transportation Systems: Balancing Safety and Intrusion In transportation systems, facial recognition is employed for security monitoring, detecting traffic violations, issuing fines, and ensuring overall safety. However, the ethics of this application are ambiguous. Where is the line drawn between ensuring public safety and intruding into the personal lives of citizens? These questions underscore the ethical dilemmas posed by the widespread use of facial recognition technology in China. While the intent behind its implementation might be rooted in security and efficiency, the extent to which it encroaches upon the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals remains a contentious issue. Striking a balance between technological advancements and preserving human rights is a challenge that demands careful consideration and ethical reflection. Concerns surrounding the obnoxious technology: A door to reality Privacy Erosion : Facial recognition technology in China has led to a widespread erosion of privacy. The country has an extensive network of surveillance cameras; in 2019, there were approximately 350 million surveillance cameras in China, and this number has likely increased since then. These cameras constantly capture citizens’ activities, both in public and private spaces, infringing upon their privacy rights. Emergence of a Surveillance State : China’s widespread use of facial recognition has effectively transformed it into a surveillance state. The government’s efforts to create a nationwide surveillance system, called the Skynet Project, demonstrate the extent of its monitoring capabilities. By 2020, China had over 20 million cameras equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and facial recognition technology, facilitating comprehensive citizen tracking. Misidentification Challenges : Despite advancements, facial recognition technology is not infallible. A study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that different facial recognition algorithms have varying accuracy rates. In real-world scenarios, misidentifications occur, leading to innocent individuals facing legal consequences. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reported an Amazon facial recognition system misidentified 28 members of Congress as criminals, raising concerns about the technology’s reliability. Bias and Discrimination : Research studies have highlighted biases in facial recognition algorithms, particularly against people with darker skin tones. A study by the Gender Shades project found that commercial gender classification systems had higher error rates for darker-skinned and female faces. In China, this bias translates into discrimination against minority groups, exacerbating social inequalities. Chilling Effects on Freedom : The omnipresence of facial recognition technology creates a climate of fear and self-censorship. The Uighur minority in Xinjiang, for instance, faces constant surveillance, leading to a chilling effect where individuals limit their expressions to avoid repercussions. Security Vulnerabilities: Storing facial data in centralized databases poses significant security risks. In 2019, a database containing 2.4 million records from a Chinese-based facial recognition database was left exposed on the internet, highlighting the vulnerability of such systems Lack of Transparency: The algorithms behind facial recognition systems are often proprietary and lack transparency. This opacity raises concerns about fairness, accountability, and the potential for misuse. The lack of clear regulations or standards exacerbates these worries booking institution. Absence of Consent: Chinese citizens lack the ability to opt out of facial recognition systems. This lack of consent infringes upon their fundamental right to control their biometric data. The absence of regulatory frameworks amplifies this powerlessness, leaving individuals at the mercy of pervasive surveillance. These concerns underscore the pressing need for international dialogues on ethical standards and regulations to ensure the responsible use of facial recognition technology and safeguard individual rights. Conclusion: In this rapidly advancing technological era, humanity should be liberated, not confined. The analogy of a caged bird perfectly encapsulates the predicament faced by individuals under constant surveillance. The question remains: what purpose does life serve if lived within such constraints? It’s imperative to break free from these shackles and soar high, embracing technology to enhance lives, fostering a future where freedom and innovation coexist harmoniously.

The answer is No! Siri or Alexa is not the first born or known chatbot. It was Eliza, a name often whispered with reverence in the realm of technology. The Chatbot that revolutionized the way technology could answer. Chat Bot, a unique yet intriguing concept. A technology that could help you answer by asking questions or in some cases do things for you connecting with your device such as Siri and Alexa. Chatbt is a concept invented in 1994 by Michael Mauldin who coined the term ‘ Chatterbot’ to describe these conversational programs. Eliza was a groundbreaking creation in the era where resources were limited and passion knew no bounds. Amidst this backdrop, in the hallowed halls of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, ELIZA, the world’s first chatbot, quietly came to life. ELIZA wasn’t just a computer program; she was an experiment in empathy, an attempt to replicate human conversation in a digital space. Her genesis/ programming was done by one of the indigenous mindsets of MIT , Joseph Weizenbaum , a visionary computer scientist. Inspired by the profound theories of Rogerian psychotherapy, ELIZA was crafted to mirror the empathetic responses of a therapist. Through cleverly designed algorithms, ELIZA engaged users in conversations that seemed remarkably human. Her charm lay not in complexity, but in the simplicity of her design—a design that sparked a revolution in the way we interact with machines. This blog delves deep into the captivating story of ELIZA, tracing her humble beginnings and exploring the profound impact she had on the fields of artificial intelligence and psychology. From her early interactions that left users astounded to her role as the progenitor of the Turing Test, ELIZA’s journey is nothing short of awe-inspiring. We unravel the essence of ELIZA, examining the challenges she faced and the legacy she left behind. As we navigate the fascinating evolution of chatbots, we pay homage to the trailblazer whose influence can still be seen on our digital conversations, reminding us of the remarkable strides we have made in the ever-expanding universe of artificial intelligence. The Birth of Eliza The birth of ELIZA was not merely a feat of programming; it was a testament to Weizenbaum’s deep understanding of human psychology and his determination to bridge the gap between man and machine. As the lines between artificial intelligence and human intellect blurred within the confines of ELIZA’s code, a new era of interactive computing was ushered in. The genesis of ELIZA was as fascinating as the era she was born into. Weizenbaum, deeply intrigued by the complexities of human communication and empathy, set out to create a computer program that could simulate conversations akin to those between a therapist and a patient. His inspiration stemmed from the pioneering work of Carl Rogers, the renowned psychologist who championed the concept of person-centered therapy, emphasizing empathy and unconditional positive regard. Eliza was named after Eliza Doolittle, a character from George Bernard Shaw’s play “Pygmalion.” The goal behind its creation was to demonstrate that even simple programming techniques could give the illusion of understanding and empathy in a conversation. Weizenbaum wanted to challenge the assumption that human-like intelligence required complex algorithms or deep knowledge representation. Eliza operates based on a set of pattern-matching rules. It analyses user input, identifies keywords, and generates responses by transforming statements into questions or reflecting them back to the user. By using cleverly crafted scripts, Eliza can create an illusion of understanding and engagement, despite lacking true comprehension. For example, if a user says, “I feel sad,” Eliza might respond with something like, “Why do you feel sad?” This simple transformation gives the impression that Eliza is actively listening and responding empathetically. Eliza had a profound impact on both the field of AI and popular culture. It sparked widespread interest in natural language processing and opened up new possibilities for human-computer interaction. Many subsequent chatbots and virtual assistants drew inspiration from Eliza’s conversational style. One notable example is Apple’s Siri, which uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries. While Siri goes far beyond Eliza in terms of functionality and capabilities, it owes its existence, at least in part, to the pioneering work of Eliza. The Turing Test and ELIZA ELIZA’s significance transcends her conversational abilities; she became a pivotal figure in the context of the Turing Test. Proposed by the British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, this test evaluates a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. ELIZA’s interactions were so convincing that many users found it challenging to discern whether they were conversing with a human or a computer program, highlighting the profound impact of her design. Ethical Considerations: Eliza also raised important ethical questions regarding the responsibility of AI developers. While ELIZA was a rudimentary chatbot, the ethical questions it raised foreshadowed concerns about more advanced AI systems. Weizenbaum was taken aback by the emotional responses people had to Eliza, even though he knew it was just a program. This experience led him to question the potential dangers of creating AI systems that could manipulate or deceive users. These concerns are still relevant today as AI technology continues to advance. The development of chatbots and virtual assistants raises questions about privacy, consent, and the potential for manipulation. Eliza serves as a reminder that we must approach AI development with careful consideration for its impact on society. Conclusion Eliza, the revolutionary chatbot developed in the 1960s, paved the way for advancements in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. Its simple yet effective pattern-matching rules created an illusion of understanding and empathy, inspiring subsequent chatbots like Siri. However, Eliza also raised ethical concerns about the responsibility of AI developers. As we continue to push the boundaries of AI technology, it is crucial to consider the potential implications and ensure that these systems are designed with transparency and accountability in mind.

China is becoming a leader in addressing the issues related to AI which will soon become a common issue for the countries around the world. The time has come where regulators shall gain a meaningful insight into the functioning of algorithms, and ensure that these algorithms are deployed in a responsible manner. China’s Algorithm Provisions, officially known as the “Provisions on the Administration of Personal Information Protection in Algorithmic Recommendation Services” (Algorithm Provisions) is the perfect example for deploying AI algorithms in an ethical and responsible manner. The provisions were passed by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) in May 2021 and which came into effect on 1 March 2022, are primarily aimed at regulating the operations of internet platforms, e-commerce companies, and tech giants operating in China. Objective behind the Regulation: Recommendation and decision-making algorithms are not impersonal, but include systematically imitating social biases. These biased results can ascend from poor quality of data on which algorithms are trained. Further other factors like incorrect inferences drawn during processing, and poor interpretation of algorithmic outputs could be the major factors. The more extensive such systems become, the higher is the chances of social biases becoming imprinted into the AI tools. Due to indignities adjoining algorithmic manipulation like those relating to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, governments are increasingly examining how to regulate algorithms so that these innovations could not be misused for benefiting few at cost of violating rights of the individuals at mass level. Against the predominant trend towards governing the AI industry, China’s Regulations stand out as the first substantial governmental effort to legally enforce algorithmic regulation, beating any laws and regulations to be formulated in advanced economies. Key Highlights: Data Protection: The provisions emphasize the protection of personal data, ensuring that algorithms do not infringe upon user privacy. Algorithmic Fairness: They promote fairness in algorithmic decision-making, combating bias and discrimination in AI systems. Transparency: Companies are required to disclose their algorithmic decision-making processes, increasing transparency for users. Accountability: Accountability mechanisms are put in place to hold companies responsible for algorithmic outcomes. User Rights: Users have the right to know when algorithms are affecting their experiences and can request explanations for algorithmic decisions. Important Provisions The Algorithm Provisions encompass various articles and regulatory measures, below are some significant inclusions: Article 7 : This article focuses on data usage and requires companies to gain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data. It emphasizes the importance of data protection and privacy. Article 9 : Article 9 deals with algorithm transparency. It mandates that companies must disclose the basic principles, mechanisms, and parameters of their algorithms used in content recommendation and other personalized services. This transparency is intended to increase user understanding and accountability. Article 14 : Article 14 addresses anti-competitive practices. It aims to prevent monopolistic behavior and unfair competition by imposing restrictions on data access, preferential treatment of products or services, and other practices that may distort the market. Article 16 : This article introduces the concept of algorithm audits, allowing regulatory authorities to inspect and assess the algorithms used by tech companies for compliance with the Algorithm Provisions. It serves as a mechanism to ensure adherence to the regulations. Implications for Tech Companies The Algorithm Provisions have several significant implications for tech companies operating in China: Algorithm Transparency : Companies must disclose the basic principles, mechanisms, and parameters of their algorithms. This transparency aims to help users understand how content recommendations are generated and to provide a degree of accountability. User Data Consent : Firms are required to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and using their personal data. This places a greater emphasis on data protection and user privacy. Anti-Competitive Practices : The provisions include provisions to prevent anti-competitive behaviours, such as unfair data access and preferential treatment of products or services. Algorithm Audits : Tech companies may be subject to algorithm audits by regulatory authorities, ensuring compliance with the provisions and preventing potential abuses. Conclusion China’s Algorithm Provisions represent a significant step in regulating the digital economy, with a focus on consumer protection, data privacy, and market competition. As digital technologies continue to evolve, regulatory efforts like these will play a crucial role in ensuring the responsible and ethical development of AI and algorithmic systems. It is gradually clear that a strong regulatory environment is a significant precondition for AI realization in order to prevent dominant firms from confining wider access to data and innovations, and to eliminate those firms hawking poor-quality or destructive AI services which may disturb markets and diminish trust. While the provisions pose challenges to tech companies, they also contribute to a more accountable and transparent digital environment, both in China and potentially beyond its borders References: FES Briefing (2023).

Its genesis can be traced back to the hallowed halls of the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) in Menlo Park, California, during the late 1960s and early 1970s. This visionary undertaking not only symbolized a pioneering effort but also laid the very cornerstone upon which countless subsequent advancements in the realms of robotics and AI would be erected . Charles Rosen, head of the AI group at SRI, recalling the origin of the robot’s name: “We worked for a month trying to find a good name for it, ranging from Greek names to whatnot, and then one of us said, ‘Hey, it shakes like hell and moves around, let’s just call it Shakey. Shakey was historically significant because of three distinct reasons:- How its control software was structured- it later became a layer for subsequent robots. Its computer vision, planning and navigation methods have been used not only in subsequent robots but also many other appliances. Shakey served as an existence proof that encouraged later developers to develop more such robots. THE HISTORICAL TAPESTRY OF SHAKEY THE ROBOT UNFURLS AS FOLLOWS : Embarking on the Quest (1966): The inception of the Shakey project transpired in 1966 under the aegis of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project (SAIL), presided over by the esteemed Dr. Charles Rosen. The audacious aim was to craft a robot endowed with the capacity to comprehend its surroundings, deliberate upon its actions, and, most remarkably, traverse an ever-changing environment independently. Forging the Mechanical Marvel: The physical manifestation of Shakey materialized atop a four-wheeled chassis, replete with an array of sensory apparatus. Among these sensory faculties were television cameras, a laser rangefinder, and collision-detecting sensors. These technological adjuncts endowed Shakey with a rudimentary form of perception. Coding the Intellect: Nevertheless, it was the software underpinning Shakey that truly set it apart. The robot was programmed utilizing the “STRIPS” (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) system—an early AI platform designed for planning and problem-solving. This software bestowed upon Shakey the ability to devise plans, resolve intricate quandaries, and carry out tasks within an environment marked by constant flux. Inaugural Exhibitions (Late 1960s): Shakey’s initial public appearances showcased its capability to execute elementary chores such as relocating objects, negotiating through doorways, and erecting stacks of blocks. These seemingly mundane tasks necessitated the robot’s capacity to perceive its surroundings, engage in strategic planning, and conduct operations autonomously. A Crucible of Innovation: The advent of Shakey catalyzed groundbreaking research across an array of AI and robotics subfields—ranging from computer vision to natural language comprehension and planning. It served as an experimental crucible for a diverse spectrum of AI methodologies. Shaping Subsequent Exploration: The profound impact of Shakey extended beyond its immediate accomplishments. It exerted an indelible influence on the trajectory of future robotic and AI research endeavors. It demonstrated, in no uncertain terms, the viability of creating intelligent, mobile automatons capable of interacting with their surroundings, rendering decisions, and navigating complex problem-solving scenarios. Legacy of Eminence: While Shakey’s capabilities may appear somewhat modest when juxtaposed against contemporary robotic achievements, its legacy remains indomitable. It inaugurated an era of empirical AI and robotics research, inspiring subsequent generations of innovators to push the boundaries of what autonomous machines could achieve. Achievements, Awards and Recognition The project attracted a lot of media attention after SRI released a 24-minute movie titled “SHAKEY: Experimentation in Robot Learning and Planning” in 1969. The New York Times published an article on Shakey on April 10, 1969; Life referred to him as the “first electronic person” in 1970; and National Geographic Magazine wrote an article about Shakey and the future of computers in November 1970. Because of the major influence of the 1969 video, the prizes for the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence’s AI Video Competition are referred to as “Shakeys.” Alongside famous robots like ASIMO and C-3PO, Shakey was honored into Carnegie Mellon University’s Robot Hall of Fame in 2004. A prestigious IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing has been awarded to Shakey. Shakey was also featured in the BBC documentary, Towards Tomorrow References- SRIInternational, The man, the myth, the legend: Meet Shakey the robot, the world’s first AI-based robot, (Nov,2021 https://www.sri.com/case-study/the-man-the-myth-the-legend-meet-shakey-the-robot-the-worlds-first-ai-based-robot/ Chris Gracia, Robots are a few of my favourite things, Computer History Museum, (June 17,2015) https://computerhistory.org/blog/robots-are-a-few-of-my-favorite-things-by-chris-garcia/", "summary": "Author: Mr. Gaurav Manhas", "published_date": "2023-10-28T09:23:09", "author": 1, "scraped_at": "2026-01-01T08:42:53.586754", "tags": [], "language": "en", "reference": {"label": "SHAKEY: THE WORLD’S FIRST AI BOT – JustAI", "domain": "justai.in", "url": "https://justai.in/shakey-the-worlds-first-ai-bot/"}}

Organisations like BioXcel Therapeutics, C-CAMP, GVK Bioscience, Strand Life Sciences, Invenire Labs use ML algorithms to accelerate the process of developing new drugs that can be used to treat patients. ML helps faster identification of potential candidates for new drugs. This is possible as ML algorithms can calculate multiple permutation & combinations of calculations in creating a drug, this takes lesser time as compared to the manual process one would have to make. Chatbots & Virtual Assistance Bots that have the medical history of patients can give primary assistance to the patient like a family doctor on their medical conditions, before consulting with a doctor. The benefit of this software is that it will be available 24/7 & can give out personalized output during emergencies. It can also handle routine administrative tasks like appointments, prescription refills etc which can free up space & time for doctors to focus on their patients. Platforms like Haptik, Niramai, HealthTap interact with patients & provide real-time support to patients. These software has the medical history of the patients in their database, which helps these algorithms to provide personalized solutions to the patient. But should realise that this self-use AI is not a replacement for doctors but only an emergency support mechanism. CgniCor’s use ML algorithm to provide healthcare information to the patient. Medication Management It is the process of ensuring that the patients receive the right medication at the right doses & at the right time. It involves several steps, including medication reconciliation, prescription, dispensing, administering, & monitoring. Electronic systems like Medication Administration Record (MAR) can be used for tracking medications that are being prescribed & administered to patients. These systems can help healthcare providers to monitor the use of the medication, identifying potential errors or/& drugs interaction with the patient, while ensuring that patients receive the right medications at the right time. Conclusion The combination of AI in medical care has introduced another time of clinical advancement. From upgrading clinical imaging investigation for exact determinations to enabling natural language processing to streamline patient records, AI is transforming the way healthcare is delivered. Clinical decision support systems provide tailored treatments, while remote patient monitoring ensures real-time care. In drug discovery, AI accelerates the identification of potential candidates. Chatbots offer 24/7 personalized assistance, and predictive analytics helps identify high-risk patients. Medication management and robotics further improve patient care. This technological revolution is not a replacement for medical professionals but a powerful ally in providing high-quality healthcare. References Puaschunder, J.M., 2019.
