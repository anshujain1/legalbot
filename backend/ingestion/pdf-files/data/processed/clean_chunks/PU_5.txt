Punjab has rolled out a series of digital reforms in treasury and accounts aimed at modernising financial administration, improving transparency, and cutting costs. Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema on Sunday said the state has already secured an incentive of Rs 450 crore in 2024-25 and is targeting Rs 350 crore in 2025-26 under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI). The reforms, implemented by the Directorate of Treasury and Accounts (DTA), include the SNA-SPARSH fund flow system for centrally sponsored schemes, a Pensioner Sewa Portal (PSP), a new Audit Management System (AMS), and non-treasury accounting modules for departments such as Forest and Works. Cheema said SNA-SPARSH, which integrates the Public Financial Management System (PFMS), state IFMS, and RBI’s E-kuber platform, has been set up to increase treasury liquidity and reduce unutilised funds lying in banks. A dedicated SNA-SPARSH treasury has been created for the purpose. The Pensioner Sewa Portal, developed in consultation with the Punjab Development Commission, provides a centralised pensioner database, enables online processing between banks and the treasury, and offers real-time updates, grievance redressal and life certificate integration. The Audit Management System allows stakeholders real-time access to audit reports and provides for regular reviews at the Administrative Secretary level to speed up resolution of audit paras. The DTA also plans to integrate Accountant General’s audit reports into the system. In another measure, the government has introduced e-vouchers for all bills, eliminating the need for physical vouchers and reducing costs on stationery, travel and processing.

Hardware for secure storage of these vouchers has been installed at the Accountant General’s office. “These initiatives are not just about upgrading software but fundamentally reforming our financial architecture to ensure every rupee is accounted for and utilised effectively,” Cheema said, adding that the reforms would lead to significant savings, improved service delivery and stronger accountability.
