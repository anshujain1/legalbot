We are proud to announce a transformative milestone in India’s digital journey — the inauguration of RackBank’s ₹1000 crore AI DataCenter Park in Raipur, Chhattisgarh. With this launch, we are not just opening a facility; we are igniting a new era of technological empowerment, digital self-reliance, and future-ready

infrastructure. Built to address the surging demand for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud solutions, this state-of-the-art campus is India’s First Dedicated AI DataCenter Park, and a cornerstone of our commitment to enabling the nation’s AI ambitions. Laying the Digital Foundation of the Future At RackBank, we believe that access to advanced computing infrastructure should not be a privilege of a few global regions. Our vision is to democratize AI and cloud access across India — and Raipur’s AI Data Center Park is the realization of that vision. The Park spans over 13.5 acres and is designed to house more than 100,000 GPUs, making it one of the most powerful computing centers in South Asia. With a robust 80 MW power capacity in its initial phase, this facility will be capable of handling massive AI workloads, large-scale model training, generative AI operations, complex simulations, and high-volume data analytics. Why Raipur? A Strategic Choice with Long-Term Impact Our choice of Raipur as the home for India’s first AI DataCenter Park was both bold and intentional. Central India holds untapped potential in terms of geography, connectivity, infrastructure, and talent. By investing here, we aim to: - Decentralize India’s digital growth - Create job opportunities and upskill local talent - Develop Raipur into a digital innovation hub This move also aligns with the Government of India’s Digital India and Make in India initiatives. We are proud to contribute to building a digitally inclusive and empowered nation where every region plays a

part in the innovation economy. Powering India’s AI Renaissance AI is rapidly transforming every industry — from healthcare and agriculture to finance, logistics, and entertainment. However, training large-scale AI models requires immense computational resources and energy. With our AI Data Center Park, RackBank is addressing this bottleneck head-on. By offering access to a massive pool of compute power, we are enabling: - Startups and enterprises to build and deploy AI solutions faster - Researchers and scientists to train large language models (LLMs) - Governments and institutions to digitize public services - Developers and engineers to experiment, scale, and innovate fearlessly Whether you’re building India’s next ChatGPT, revolutionizing precision agriculture, or automating a billion banking transactions, we have the infrastructure to support your vision. Built with Purpose: Sustainability at the Core As we scale our digital infrastructure, we are equally committed to sustainability and energy efficiency. The AI Data Center Park is designed with: - Advanced cooling systems that minimize energy usage - Optimized power distribution and backup systems - Integration of green energy sources in the upcoming phases We understand that the future of AI and cloud must be as green as it is powerful. As responsible digital pioneers, we are setting new standards for sustainable hyperscale computing in India. Skill Development and Job Creation With the launch of this facility, we’re not only generating digital capacity — we’re also creating real impact on the ground. The AI Data Center Park is expected to: - Create over 3,000 direct and

indirect employment opportunities - Drive upskilling programs in AI, data science, and data center operations - Enable industry-academia partnerships for hands-on tech education We envision the park as a knowledge hub, where the next generation of Indian tech talent can thrive, learn, and lead global innovation from Raipur. Leadership Speaks: A Bold Vision for a Digital Bharat Our Founder and CEO, Narendra Sen, emphasized during the launch: “This is more than just a data center — it is a mission to put India on the global AI map. We are laying the foundation for AI sovereignty, where Indian enterprises can innovate without limitations and data can stay within national borders.” Indeed, in a time when data sovereignty and AI independence are emerging as national imperatives, this launch couldn’t be more timely. RackBank is proud to be a flagbearer of this vision. Strengthening India’s AI Ecosystem We invite AI startups, cloud-native companies, global hyperscalers, and enterprise tech leaders to collaborate with us. Our platform is designed to be vendor-neutral, scalable, and developer-friendly, ensuring seamless integration and support for your AI and cloud workloads. With this AI Data Center Park, we are creating an ecosystem — not just a facility. One that fosters innovation, drives investments, and supports India’s mission to become a $1 trillion digital economy. Looking Ahead: More Than Just the First While this is India’s first AI Data Center Park, it’s only the beginning. At RackBank, we have an aggressive roadmap to launch similar data center parks across Tier

II and Tier III cities, enabling true digital democratization. Our upcoming phases in Raipur itself will see: - Expansion to 160 MW+ power capacity - Integration of liquid cooling and next-gen chip tech - Hosting environments for sovereign cloud initiatives India is rising — and RackBank is committed to being its digital backbone.
