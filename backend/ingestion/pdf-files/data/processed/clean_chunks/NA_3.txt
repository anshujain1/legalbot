DIMAPUR, JULY 25 (MExN): NITI Nagaland has announced that it will be organising a free seminar on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for youth and their guardians at its Dimapur Centre in Marwari Patti on July 26, starting from 10 AM. Alovi Chishi, an MTech in AI, will be the resource person for the seminar, which is being organised as part of NITI’s Silver Jubilee celebrations. In a press release, the institute informed that Chishi will help “demystify” the role of AI in today’s job market and highlight the immense potential it holds for tomorrow’s workforce. The event also aims to raise awareness about how AI is rapidly transforming industries, and how early exposure and understanding can benefit the youth of Nagaland, it added. Key highlights of the seminar will include an introduction to AI and its global impact, its relevance for Indian youth and local job opportunities, and career pathways in the field. The session will be followed by an interactive Q&A with the speaker. Informing that only 50 seats are available, the institute encouraged early registration for the free session.
