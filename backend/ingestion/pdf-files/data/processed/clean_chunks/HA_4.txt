These priorities have also been incorporated into the state budget for the current financial year. To prepare Haryana for the future, a new entity called the Department of Future has been established. This department will explore development opportunities through cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, and Robotics. Acting as a nodal agency, the Department of Future will spearhead long-term strategic initiatives, technological foresight, and integrated policy-making to realize a trillion-dollar economy and promote inclusive development, aligned with Haryana’s Vision 2047.

The Haryana Venture Capital Fund is actively working to promote startups by providing internships, mentorship, and affordable infrastructure for the youth. In addition, the state government has encouraged private investors to create a Fund of Funds worth Rs 2,000 crore, aimed at positioning Haryana as a major hub for innovation and entrepreneurship through strategic investments in startups. The Chief Minister highlighted that technical barriers are a significant challenge to the rapid economic development, and the shelf life of skills is

decreasing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to modernize the skill ecosystem. To address this, he proposed the development of an Integrated Skill Hub to better equip the workforce for future demands. He said that the Haryana government launched a high-level task force called ‘Mission Haryana-2047’ last year, which has begun working towards achieving a state GDP of one trillion US dollars and creating 50 lakh new jobs.

He highlighted that all projects costing over Rs 100 crore are now required to align with the National Master Plan of PM Gati Shakti. To ease regulatory hurdles, more than 1,100 complex compliances have been simplified, creating a favorable environment for investors in the state. He further said that the state government will soon establish an Ease of Doing Business Cell to further streamline processes. Efforts are also underway to eliminate criminalization from minor provisions across more than 230 Acts in 37 departments.
