Rajasthan Draft AI Policy 2025 proposes centre of excellence, multi-level governance structure The policy is aimed at promoting the use of artificial intelligence in sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, education, and urban governance. The Department of Information Technology and Communication (DoIT&C), Government of Rajasthan, is preparing to introduce the Rajasthan Artificial Intelligence Policy 2025, aimed at promoting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, education, and urban governance. The draft policy was discussed during a one-day stakeholder consultation workshop held at Rajasthan International Centre. Addressing the event, Principal Secretary of the department Archana Singh said that the policy seeks to improve public service delivery and support the use of AI across key sectors. The draft has been uploaded on the department’s website for public consultation, and suggestions from individuals and stakeholders are invited. The workshop was held in two sessions. The first session included participation from professionals representing companies such as Oracle, IBM, Orbit, Ernst & Young, and NEC. The second session included inputs from representatives of IIM Udaipur, IIT Kanpur, IIT Jodhpur, MNIT Jaipur, as well as startups, researchers, and students working in AI. Deepak Pathania from NEC stated that the policy could benefit from a practical approach and suggested including any remaining possibilities into the draft. Vibha from Ernst & Young said the draft includes key components and proposed the addition of a playbook to help clarify ethical AI implementation. Saurabh Srivastava from the Digital Empowerment Foundation suggested including provisions to address issues such as

financial fraud and deepfake content, and also proposed establishing green data centers. Himanshu Daga, a startup founder, commented on the need for AI systems to maintain reliability and accountability. Gurpreet Kaur, Vice Chancellor of National Law University, Jodhpur, discussed legal aspects of AI and highlighted the need to train teachers in the use of AI tools. The draft policy includes objectives such as improving public service delivery, supporting responsible AI development, creating a legal framework, developing a skilled workforce, supporting research and innovation, and ensuring access to AI technology. The policy is based on three components: adoption of AI in government systems, skill development and research, and building digital infrastructure. The Centre of Excellence for AI (CoE–AI) will play a key role in the effective implementation of this policy. The centre will support research, innovation, and startups, and will promote collaboration across government, academic, and private sectors. The policy is aligned with the National India AI Mission and incorporates global best practices. The draft policy also proposes the establishment of a multi-tier institutional framework, which will include an AI Apex Committee, Steering Committee, AI Task Force, and departmental AI Nodal Officers. The policy aims to position Rajasthan as a leading state in the adoption of responsible and inclusive AI.
