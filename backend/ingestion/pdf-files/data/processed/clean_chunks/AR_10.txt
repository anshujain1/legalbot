Itanagar: State govt will install AI-enabled cameras across all towns and cities, in a phased manner, to enhance public safety, Arunachal Pradesh home minister Mama Natung said on Friday. He said the state govt has already initiated the process of installing AI-enabled CCTV cameras at 22 check-gates to prevent the movement of unwanted elements and restricted items along their inter-state boundaries with Assam and Nagaland. "We will install state-of-the-art AI-enabled traffic cameras and CCTV cameras across all cities and towns in a phased manner to enhance public safety and security," Natung said. Addressing the drug menace, Natung said that under the Mukhya Mantri Nasha Mukti Yojana, the govt is taking a multi-faceted approach to combat drug abuse, including treatment and rehabilitation. "We have established five drug de-addiction centres and constituted the Arunachal Pradesh Drug De-Addiction Society," he said.
