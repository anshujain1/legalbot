Panaji: The ‘Goa On The Go’ app, designed for bus services, will include an innovative feature, a WhatsApp chatbot, allowing passengers to book bus tickets via the instant messaging platform. “There are a lot of other components that we want to introduce, one of which is the WhatsApp chatbot so that ticket booking is simplified. We need a composite relook at it, on which we are working,” transport director Pravimal Abhishek told The app will also support online payment through a digital platform, making the booking process more convenient for smartphone users. “The app will work in a more systematic and comprehensive manner. It will digitise the back-end operations of the KTC to a certain extent as well. We are actively working on this right now and will be able to share more details in the coming weeks,” he said. TOI reported on Aug 30 that the uncertainty over bus timings is set to change with the launch of ‘Goa On The Go’, which can be used by public bus commuters. Commuters will be able to track the exact location of their bus, its distance from the nearest stop, and its expected arrival and departure times with the help of this app. With live tracking, passengers can better plan their travel, minimise waiting times, and avoid missing buses. The integration of ticket booking also means fewer cash transactions and greater convenience for those used to digital payments. Plans were initially under way to roll out the app in Sep, with

availability for both Android and iOS users. However, the launch was then scheduled for the 45th anniversary celebration of the KTC in Panaji. With the new features pending inclusion, the launch has been delayed. Its revised launch date will likely be in Jan next year.
