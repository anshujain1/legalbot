Urban planners ideally aim at developing the entire urban eco-system, which is represented by the four pillars of comprehensive development-institutional, physical, social and economic infrastructure. This can be a long-term goal and cities can work towards developing such comprehensive infrastructure incrementally, adding on layers of ‘smartness’. The Government of India intends to transform 100 Indian cities into Smart Cities. Guwahati was one of the twenty cities to be selected in the first round of smart cities challenge. Guwahati has incorporated a special purpose vehicle (SPV) – Guwahati Smart City Limited (GSCL) (the 'Authority') to plan, design, implement, coordinate and monitor the smart city projects in Guwahati. GSCL is a company incorporated under Indian Companies Act 2013 with equal shareholding from Govt. of Assam. The basic objective of the assignment is to support GSCL to Development of proposed ABD Modules and PAN City proposal. TCE will provide strategic, advisory, liaising, consultancy and project management services to support GSCL in planning, designing, implementing and monitoring Area Based Development Project under the Guwahati smart city proposal. The SPV has been established on 11th May 2016. Also, Total authorized capital of SPV has proposed Rs. 400.00 Crore and total paid up capital of the SPV is Rs. 378.00 Crore. As per the Government of India, the total proposed cost for Guwahati smart city is around Rs. 2296 Crore; which includes Area Based Development (ABD) cost is approx Rs. 1579 Crore and Pan City cost are approx Rs. 622 Crore.
