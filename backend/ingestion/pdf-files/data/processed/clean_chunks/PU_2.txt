AI enters public health in Punjab: Over 700 suspected stroke patients screened Chandigarh: Within just a few months of its launch, Punjab's AI-Driven Stroke Project has screened more than 700 suspected patients. The system enabled six patients suffering from severe strokes to undergo a complex, life-saving brain clot-removal procedure, known as , completely free of cost."Through this project, we are not just saving lives but also preventing devastating disabilities. Punjab govt is providing mechanical thrombectomy, which can cost between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 6 lakh in private hospitals, entirely free of cost to patients. This ensures that financial constraints do not stand in the way of a patient's recovery and a second chance at life," said Punjab health and family welfare minister Dr Balbir Singh.Under the project, suspected stroke patients arriving at select centres—district hospitals in Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Sangrur, and Government Medical College, Patiala—immediately undergo a CT scan. This scan is then analysed in minutes by sophisticated AI technology from Qure.ai, with the results instantly shared with a team of specialist neurologists at the central hub, Christian Medical College (CMC), Ludhiana.These experts, led by Dr Jeyaraj Pandian, Dr Ivy Sebastian, and Dr Rajeshwar Sahonta, provide real-time, long-distance guidance to the doctors at the select centres. For patients identified as requiring advanced intervention, a swift and coordinated transfer to CMC Ludhiana is initiated for life-saving procedures.Dr Balbir emphasised the project's initial results were profoundly encouraging. "This is a transformative model that delivers swift, expert care directly to citizens in their

moment of greatest need. Chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann led Punjab govt is fully committed to expanding this proven initiative across Punjab to ensure equitable access to world-class stroke care for all," he added.What is a mechanical thrombectomy?Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive, life-saving procedure to remove a blood clot from a brain artery during a severe ischemic stroke. It is a highly complex procedure that must be performed within a critical time window to restore blood flow to the brain, significantly reducing the risk of death and long-term disability. - Moo-ving forward: How ‘cow science’is transforming Raj’s rural landscape - West Bengal horror: Medical student 'gang-raped'; victim went out for dinner with friends - Cheers to tears: How party in 'parking lot' ended in tragedy for BTech student; a police brutality in MP - ‘Facing constant noise, heat from Metro tower near our C’gate bldg’ - Punjab: Bodybuilder Varinder Singh Ghuman’s friends, family allege medical negligence; seek operation theatre footage - Who is Valentin Vacherot’s girlfriend Emily Snyder?
