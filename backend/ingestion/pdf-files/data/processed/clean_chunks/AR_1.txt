Itanagar, [Date] — In a landmark move toward inclusive education, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu today handed over KIBO, a cutting-edge AI-driven reading device, to students of the Donyi Polo Mission School for the Hearing and Visually Impaired. The initiative marks a transformative step in empowering children with hearing and visual impairments by giving them independent access to knowledge through assistive technology. “Very happy to hand over KIBO, a powerful AI-driven reading device, to the students of Donyi Polo Mission School for the Hearing and Visually Impaired,” CM Pema Khandu shared in a post on his official WhatsApp channel. “With KIBO, our children can now access printed, handwritten, and digital content on their own, in their own language, and at their own pace.” KIBO is designed to convert text—whether from books, worksheets, or digital screens—into accessible audio in local languages, enabling differently-abled learners to study independently and with greater confidence. The device supports multilingual functionality, making it particularly impactful in a linguistically diverse state like Arunachal Pradesh. The Chief Minister expressed his gratitude to the Department of Social Justice & Empowerment and Trestle Labs, the technology partner behind KIBO, for bringing this visionary project to life. “My heartfelt thanks to the Department of Social Justice & Empowerment and Trestle Labs for turning vision into reality,” he said. “Because real progress happens when innovation meets compassion, and when no one is left behind.” The launch has been widely applauded by educators, parents, and disability rights advocates, who hailed it as

a major leap toward equitable education in the state. CM Khandu reiterated the government’s commitment to leveraging technology for social inclusion and promised the expansion of such initiatives to other schools across Arunachal Pradesh. The KIBO rollout is part of the state’s broader mission to build an inclusive, future-ready education system where every child—regardless of ability—has the opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed.
