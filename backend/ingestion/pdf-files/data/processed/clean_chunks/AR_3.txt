Drone Port Launched at Arunachal’s TRIHMS to Boost Healthcare Access A dedicated drone port has been opened on the roof of the Tomo Riba Institute of Health & Medical Sciences (TRIHMS) in Naharlagun, Arunachal Pradesh, in a historic move meant to improve healthcare delivery through cutting-edge technology. By facilitating the quick aerial delivery of vital supplies to isolated and inaccessible areas of the state, the facility, created by the Arunachal Pradesh Space Application Centre (APSAC), is expected to revolutionize emergency medical services. Chief Medical Superintendent Dr. D. Raina, APSAC Director Dr. H. Dutta, Joint Director and Nodal Officer Dr. Liagi Tajo, Deputy Directors Nyelam That and Chau Ken Manlong, and other senior officials from TRIHMS and APSAC attended the inauguration ceremony yesterday, which was presided over by TRIHMS Director Dr. Moji Jini. “The creation of this drone port represents a significant milestone in enhancing healthcare access,” Dr. Jini said, praising APSAC’s innovative work. During emergencies, it will make it easier to deliver anti-venoms, life-saving medications, and even human organs to remote locations. Drone technology has been actively used by APSAC in a number of domains, such as 3D terrain modeling, infrastructure planning, power line and road alignment, and resource mapping. In partnership with the State Health & Family Welfare Department, the organization has already carried out successful experimental trials of drone-based medication delivery. Both Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) and Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) drones can be operated at the recently opened Drone Port. It is a complete operational

hub for aerial healthcare logistics, with specific areas for launch, storage, and maintenance. This program falls under the broader category of state-led initiatives like “Medicine from the Sky,” which are designed to close the last-mile delivery gaps in healthcare, especially in areas that are remote or vulnerable to natural disasters. To guarantee that everyone has timely and equitable access to healthcare, the state government plans to replicate this model in several locations.
