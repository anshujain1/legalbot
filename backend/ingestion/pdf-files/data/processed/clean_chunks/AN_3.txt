In a landmark move set to redefine India’s digital landscape, the Government of Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday (October 14, 2025) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with global tech giant Google to establish a world-class AI-powered data centre in Visakhapatnam. The project represents an investment of ₹87,520 crore ($15 billion) — Google’s largest-ever investment outside the United States. The MoU was signed in the presence of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union IT and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Andhra Pradesh IT Minister Nara Lokesh, and Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian, along with senior officials from the Centre and the state. The state-of-the-art data centre, with a capacity of one gigawatt, will be connected via subsea cable links to Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and 12 other countries. The initiative is expected to position Visakhapatnam as a global connectivity hub while boosting sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and industry through advanced AI-driven digital infrastructure. Ecosystem partners, AdaniConneX and Bharti Airtel, will support the rollout. Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman hailed the collaboration as a milestone in India’s digital evolution. “The establishment of an AI Data Centre and subsea cable landing station in Visakhapatnam is a major stride toward our national growth vision. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, India’s digital future is taking shape through progressive governance,” she said. She added that Andhra Pradesh’s efficient digital systems made it a natural choice for such a transformative initiative. Mr. Ashwini Vaishnaw expressed gratitude to

Google for choosing India as its major investment destination. “This project will transform lives and bring immense benefits to people across the nation. States like Andhra Pradesh, which prioritise technology, are key to achieving ‘Viksit Bharat 2047’,” he said. He also revealed plans to link South Asia and Australia through the new subsea system and expand optical fiber networks across India’s Northeast using railway corridors. Mr. Naidu described Google’s investment as a “moment of pride” for Andhra Pradesh. “It is heartening to see Google commit $15 billion to this project. I thank Prime Minister Modi and Union Ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Nirmala Sitharaman for their unwavering support and congratulate IT Minister Nara Lokesh for his crucial role in bringing this landmark project to Visakhapatnam,” he said. Recalling his pioneering role in India’s IT revolution during the creation of Hyderabad’s Hitec City, Mr. Naidu emphasised the importance of data-driven governance. “With real-time and historical data, faster and smarter decisions are possible. Prime Minister Modi, upon learning about the project, suggested organising a Global AI Conference in Visakhapatnam next February,” he revealed. IT and HRD Minister Nara Lokesh called the project the start of a new technological revolution. “Just as Y2K transformed Hyderabad and Bengaluru, the AI revolution will transform Visakhapatnam. Our goal is to merge education and IT to produce tangible, real-world outcomes,” he said. Mr. Kurian termed the initiative a historic milestone for the company and India. “This project will make Visakhapatnam a major global connectivity hub. Alongside Gemini AI

and advanced Google Cloud services, we will nurture world-class AI professionals here,” he stated. Mr. Kurian reaffirmed Google’s five-year commitment to strengthening India’s digital infrastructure and expanding international connectivity from Visakhapatnam to multiple nations.
