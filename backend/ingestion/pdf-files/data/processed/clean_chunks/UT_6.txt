The Uttar Pradesh government is planning to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the delivery of social welfare schemes. This new step aims to make these schemes more effective, transparent, and free from mistakes or fraud. The Social Welfare Department of UP wants to use AI technology to closely monitor important schemes like old age pension, family benefits, scholarships, and mass marriages. The goal is to make sure the benefits reach the right people without any delays or errors. AI will help check the data of applicants more accurately, identify genuine beneficiaries, and stop fake claims. This will reduce irregularities and speed up the entire process. It will also help the government work faster, make records paperless, and increase accountability. Recently, the government held a special workshop titled “Use of AI in Social Welfare Schemes,” attended by Social Welfare Minister Asim Arun. The department is focusing on improving online monitoring for schemes such as Scholarships, National Family Benefit, and Old Age Pension. For example, in the Scholarship Scheme, students now have a one-time registration number. This means they don’t need to register repeatedly, saving time and ensuring continuous benefits. Adding AI will make this process even more secure and quicker. Using AI and data analytics will allow only real beneficiaries to access schemes. The technology will quickly process applications and flag any suspicious or fake entries. Going paperless will reduce unnecessary paperwork and help the government deliver services faster. Officials believe AI will bring major improvements in managing data, verifying

beneficiaries, and monitoring schemes. It will also simplify administrative work and build more trust between the public and the government.

With better monitoring and faster processes, the government hopes to serve its people better and build more confidence in its programs.
