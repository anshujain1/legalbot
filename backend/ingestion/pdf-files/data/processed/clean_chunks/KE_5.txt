Kerala Unveils Vision 2031 to Achieve $50 Billion IT Value and 5 Lakh Jobs The Kerala government has unveiled a draft “IT Vision 2031” plan, outlining an ambitious roadmap to generate $50 billion in economic value and create over five lakh high-value jobs by 2031. The document envisions transforming Kerala into a global hub for ethical and sustainable technology, leveraging its skilled workforce, robust digital infrastructure, and strong public governance framework. Strategic Goals for Growth and Investment Under the Vision 2031 framework, the state targets attracting ₹20,000 crore in startup investments, nurturing 20,000 startups, and developing 30 million square feet of new IT office space. The plan emphasises responsible innovation and aims to position Kerala as a leader in technology sectors including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and advanced digital services. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan released the draft document at the “ReCode Kerala 2025” seminar in Kochi. Four Key Missions to Drive Transformation To execute the digital roadmap, Kerala has launched four major initiatives — the Kerala Artificial Intelligence Mission (K-AIM), Kerala Semiconductor Mission, Kerala Future Tech Mission (KFTM), and The Future Corporation (TFC). The AI Mission will introduce a “Kerala AI Bill of Rights” by 2030 to ensure the ethical use of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, The Future Corporation will operate as a global investment agency under the brand “Kerala: Global Talent. Ethical Tech. Sustainable Growth,” promoting the state’s technology ecosystem internationally. Infrastructure and Policy Reforms for IT Expansion The Vision 2031 document proposes a new IT Policy and a dedicated Global

Capability Centres (GCC) Policy to attract 120 GCCs by 2031. Planned developments include Infopark Phase 3 (AI City), Technopark Phase 4, Kozhikode IT projects, and the K-Space Aerospace Cluster. These projects aim to establish Kerala as one of India’s top digital and innovation destinations, supported by strong connectivity through the Kerala Fibre Optic Network (KFON). - Kerala’s IT Vision 2031 targets $50 billion in IT value by 2031. - The plan aims to generate 5 lakh jobs and ₹20,000 crore in startup investments. - A “Kerala AI Bill of Rights” will be introduced by 2030 under the K-AIM initiative. - The state plans to host 250 AVGC companies and 120 Global Capability Centres by 2031. Innovation, Skills, and Sustainable Technology Focus Vision 2031 also proposes establishing 50 Leap Centres, 250 Early Innovation Centres, and 14 district-level Freedom Squares to promote entrepreneurship and women-led startups. The plan seeks to train one million individuals in AI and related technologies through the ICT Academy and reduce government software expenditure by 30% via Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) adoption. By leveraging its talent pool, low attrition rate, and strong digital infrastructure, Kerala aims to redefine its IT growth model as globally responsible, innovation-driven, and inclusive.
