Honorable Chief Minister Launches Ten Transformative Services under NGDRS in Chhattisgarh On Saturday, May 3, 2025, at the May Fair Resort in New Raipur, the Honorable Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Shri Vishnu Dev Sai, formally launched ten transformative services under the National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS). This landmark initiative reflects the state government’s commitment to making property registration more efficient, transparent, people-centric, and free from intermediaries. The event was attended by Cabinet Ministers Shri O.P. Choudhary and Shri Tankram Verma, Chief Secretary Shri Amitabh Jain, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Shri Subodh Singh, Secretary (Registration), Inspector General of Registration, and State Informatics Officer Shri T.N. Singh, along with officers from the National Informatics Centre (NIC). These services, developed by NIC teams at the Software Development Unit in Pune and the Chhattisgarh State Centre, are designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of property transactions—from deed preparation to mutation—through digital means. The ten services launched are: Facilitates automatic drafting of sale deeds through the online portal. This eliminates the need to visit deed writers or stamp vendors and makes the process paperless and efficient. 2. Integrated Digital Payment (Cashless Transactions) Enables single-window cashless payment of both stamp duty and registration fees via UPI, credit/debit cards, POS machines, net banking, or e-challan. 3. Home Registry (Faceless Registration) A fully digital registration system where parties are verified through video KYC, removing the need to physically visit Sub-Registrar Offices. Allows users to search for registered deeds by party name or Khasra number, enhancing

accessibility and transparency. Citizens can now obtain digitally signed certified copies of registered documents directly through the portal, avoiding manual visits. A significant reform wherein NGDRS is integrated with the Bhuiyan land record system, ensuring automatic updating of the buyer’s name in revenue records post-registration. Enables citizens to book appointments for registration online, reducing overcrowding and wait times at registration offices. Parties receive automated SMS and email notifications at each stage of the registration process, ensuring timely updates and transparency. Introduces a centralized dashboard for real-time monitoring of application status, turnaround times, and performance analytics at various Sub-Registrar Offices. 10. Bilingual Interface for Accessibility The NGDRS portal has been enhanced to support both Hindi and English, ensuring inclusivity for a broader user base. During the event, the Honorable Chief Minister interacted via videoconference with beneficiaries of the auto-mutation service at the Sub-Registrar Office, New Raipur, and handed over digitally signed land records. Additionally, five beneficiaries were presented with physical copies of their registered documents at the venue. These reforms reflect a paradigm shift in the delivery of land registration services—aligning technology, governance, and public service in a citizen-first approach. By minimizing manual intervention, eliminating middlemen, and embracing automation, the Government of Chhattisgarh is setting a model for digital transformation in revenue administration.
