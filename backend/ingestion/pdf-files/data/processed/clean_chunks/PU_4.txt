Chandigarh: Punjab will become the first state to launch a unified citizen portal, a single-window platform that will provide seamless access to a wide range of govt services across various departments, Aman Arora, minister of good governance and information technology, announced on Friday. Arora said the department of good governance and information technology had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth Rs 13 crore with E-connect Solutions Pvt Ltd for the comprehensive designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining of the new citizen portal. He said the portal would be launched within six months to ensure maximum accessibility, efficiency, and accountability in the delivery of govt services. The citizen portal will be accessible via web, mobile app, Sewa Kendras, and WhatsApp to bring governance to citizens' fingertips, Arora added. The AAP leader said the new citizen portal would be a single, unified digital gateway for all govt services, catering to citizens' needs throughout their lifecycle. A key feature is the auto-fetching of documents, eliminating the need for repeated submissions of documents. Once a citizen uploads documents for any kind of service, they will be automatically retrieved for future applications. This will streamline services and enhance the citizen experience, he added.
