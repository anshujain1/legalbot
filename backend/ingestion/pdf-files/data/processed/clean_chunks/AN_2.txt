Our First AI Hub in India, Powered by a $15 Billion Investment India is experiencing a digital transformation that is unparalleled in pace and scale. At Google Cloud, we are deeply committed to being a foundational partner in this journey, working alongside the Indian government and industry leaders to realize the vision of a truly AI-first nation. Today, we are announcing a landmark commitment: our largest investment in India to date, totaling approximately $15 billion (USD) over the next five years (2026-2030). This capital will establish our first Artificial Intelligence (AI) hub in the country, located in the vibrant city of Visakhapatnam (Vizag), Andhra Pradesh. This AI hub is a multi-faceted investment combining powerful gigawatt scale data center operations, new large-scale energy sources, and an expanded fiber-optic network, and has the potential to accelerate AI-driven transformation across every sector. This investment aligns directly with the Government of India’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision. We also see this infrastructure as playing a role in anchoring the next phase of the U.S.–India tech cooperation, particularly as both nations prioritize the secure, responsible development of AI. It’s an investment that will create high-value jobs in India, while also stimulating economic activity back in the U.S. through related research and development. This is about pioneering a generational shift in AI capability that benefits both economies. Infrastructure Built for Scale and Speed To meet India's surging digital demands, the Visakhapatnam AI hub will include a purpose-built data center campus capable of gigawatt-scale compute capacity. This facility

will be built to the same exacting standards that power global Google services like Search, YouTube, and Workspace. It is critical that businesses, developers, and researchers have access to the highest-performance, lowest-latency services. Working with partners, AdaniConnex and Airtel, this hub will deliver the kind of reliable, advanced infrastructure necessary for large enterprises and innovative Indian startups alike to build and scale their own AI-powered solutions, and ultimately help India secure its place as a global leader in the AI-driven future. A New Global Connectivity Gateway Our commitment extends beyond the data center walls. This investment includes the construction of a major new international subsea gateway. By bringing multiple international subsea cables to land in Visakhapatnam, we are creating an essential connectivity hub on India’s eastern coast. This new pathway will complement existing landings in Mumbai and Chennai, providing necessary route diversity and increasing the resilience of India's digital backbone. Subsea cable landings in Vizag will enhance connectivity and boost the resilience of India's digital backbone This critical infrastructure will deliver faster experiences for our users and customers and will drive digital inclusivity and transformation, bringing the benefits of AI to more people and businesses nationwide. Finally, we recognize that growth must be responsible. Google already operates some of the most energy-efficient data centers in the world. As we expand, we will be working with partners to deliver new transmission lines, clean energy generation, and energy storage systems in Andhra Pradesh, expanding the diverse portfolio of clean energy that contributes

to India’s electricity grid. The Google AI hub in Visakhapatnam is a landmark investment in India’s digital future. We believe that by delivering industry-leading AI infrastructure at this scale, we are creating meaningful opportunities for growth and helping to drive a transformative impact for society.
