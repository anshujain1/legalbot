In a landmark move towards enhancing digital governance, the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Manipur has inaugurated the National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) in the Manipur Legislative Assembly. This initiative, developed by the NIC, is set to revolutionize the way legislative business is conducted in the state. NeVA is a sophisticated workflow-based application designed to facilitate the smooth conduct of the proceedings of the House. It allows for a paperless assembly, thereby promoting environmental sustainability and operational efficiency. The application is expected to transform the traditional paper-reliant legislative process by digitizing all records, including questions, answers, debates, and reports, ensuring real-time availability and access. The Chief Minister, in his address during the launch, highlighted the significance of NeVA in the current digital era. He emphasized that this system is not just about going paperless but is a step towards a more transparent, accountable, and responsive legislative process. The implementation of NeVA is a testament to Manipur’s commitment to adopting innovative technologies for better governance. The launch event demonstrated various features of the NeVA, showcasing how it can aid the Chair of the House in managing the day-to-day activities of the legislative assembly more effectively. The system ensures seamless coordination among various departments, members of the legislative assembly, and other stakeholders, thereby enhancing the overall productivity of the legislative process.
