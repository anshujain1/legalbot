The system aims to streamline industrial approvals and reduce delays significantly, reinforcing the state’s commitment to ease of doing business. During the event, CM Sai emphasised the state's shift from a Naxal-affected past to a future rooted in high-tech industries such as semiconductors, AI, defence, aerospace, and pharmaceuticals. He highlighted the government’s new policies including the State Logistics Policy–2025 and the Jan Vishwas Bill, both of which are designed to catalyse investment and reduce red tape. The Chief Minister announced that Chhattisgarh had received Rs 1.23 lakh crore in new investment proposals during the event alone, with 20,627 jobs expected to be generated. Companies like Sarda Hydropower, Jindal Steel, and ESDS Software Solutions were among the 11 that received investment letters. The newly launched logistics policy will position Chhattisgarh as a major logistics and export hub, with a focus on dry ports, inland waterways, warehousing, and lower transport costs.

Meanwhile, the Jan Vishwas Bill will help simplify legal processes for entrepreneurs, making business operations smoother and less litigative. CM Sai also detailed progress on connectivity projects such as new railway lines and inland waterways, and the establishment of India’s first AI Data Centre Park in Chhattisgarh. Nava Raipur is being developed as the state's own Silicon Valley, with a semiconductor unit already operational. In a boost to regional development, the CM spoke of transforming Bastar and Sarguja through employment, tourism, and incentives for tribal entrepreneurs. With plans to eliminate Naxalism by March 2026, he stressed the state's united focus on peace and progress. The event was also attended by Industries Minister Shri Lakhan Lal Dewangan and top industry leaders and government officials, who reiterated the government’s dedication to transparent and efficient industrial processes.
