Vadodara: In a first for Gujarat, state-run SSG Hospital, the largest govt hospital in central Gujarat, has introduced an AI-powered oncology chatbot to assist cancer patients and their families. The digital platform has been developed by Dr Shivang Shukla, surgical oncologist at SSG Hospital, to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare services. The chatbot is designed to reduce anxiety, spread awareness, and encourage timely treatment. "This platform provides instant, reliable, and patient-friendly guidance on cancer care, including information on surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy," Dr. Shukla said. "It also offers post-treatment care and follow-up instructions in Gujarati, Hindi and English, making it highly accessible." Apart from treatment guidance, the chatbot helps patients manage symptoms and side effects, while also providing OPD details for easy access. Officials said the initiative is aimed at making cancer care simpler, faster and more approachable for patients and caregivers.
