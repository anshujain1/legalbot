Kerala’s AI-Enabled Classroom Revolution Over the past two decades, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE), formerly known as the IT@School project, has been a trailblazer in revolutionising digital education in Kerala, elevating it to unprecedented heights. Since its inception in 2001, KITE has spearheaded initiatives ranging from teacher capacity building and ICT content development to ensuring robust ICT infrastructure in schools and implementing e-governance systems. Today, KITE’s scope has expanded to include Artificial Intelligence (AI) training for teachers, the deployment of robotic kits for students, and the integration of AI into the school curriculum. These milestones are the culmination of relentless dedication, research and innovation by KITE’s techno-academic teams, positioning Kerala as a global model for technology-driven education The Hi-Tech Classroom Revolution A cornerstone of KITE’s achievements is its role in the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission, a state government initiative aimed at modernising education. Through the KIIFB-funded Hi-Tech School Project, KITE transformed 45,000 classrooms across Standards 8 to 12 in 4,752 secondary schools into hi-tech learning environments between 2016 and 2019. This project, the largest ICT initiative in Indian education, was remarkable not only for its scale but also for its funding and the millions of students it benefited. Each hi-tech classroom was equipped with a laptop, ceiling-mounted projector, USB speakers, networking capabilities and access to the SAMAGRA Resource Portal, a KITE-developed digital repository. Following this, KITE extended its efforts to primary education through the Hi-Tech Lab Project, upgrading 11,257 primary schools to match the technological standards of secondary

schools. These projects collectively deployed over 4,50,000 ICT devices to government and government-aided schools, all supported by broadband internet connectivity, a five-year warranty and comprehensive support systems, including a call centre, web portal and annual maintenance contracts for laptops and projectors. This infrastructure overhaul was part of a broader vision to elevate school education holistically, encompassing academic excellence, learning environments, laboratories, libraries and extracurricular activities to international standards. SAMAGRA: A Digital Treasure Trove Central to KITE’s digital ecosystem is the SAMAGRA Resource Portal, a comprehensive repository of educational content for students from Class 1 to 12. SAMAGRA offers e-resources, textbooks and question banks in various formats, including images, videos, animations, interactive narrations and tutorials. Available in four mediums of instruction—Malayalam, English, Tamil and Kannada—the portal ensures inclusivity and accessibility, catering to Kerala’s diverse linguistic landscape. By providing high-quality, curriculumaligned digital content, SAMAGRA empowers both teachers and students to engage with education in dynamic and innovative ways. Little KITEs: Nurturing Tech-Savvy Innovators In 2018–19, KITE launched the Little KITEs IT Clubs initiative to foster creativity and technological proficiency among students. Targeting students in Standard 8, the programme selects members through an aptitude test assessing their interest in ICT. Each Little KITEs unit, comprising 20 to 40 students, is led by a unit leader and deputy leader, with activities overseen by a KITE Master and KITE Mistress—teachers nominated by the head teacher. The clubs provide hands-on training in cuttingedge fields such as AI, robotics, 3D character designing, cyber-safety and language computing through

specialised camps. In 2023–24, KITE distributed 29,000 Arduino Uno Robotic Kits to Little KITEs IT Clubs, enabling students to explore robotics and develop practical skills. The initiative promotes healthy competition by recognising top-performing clubs and students while phasing out underperforming units through annual evaluations. By encouraging knowledge sharing and societal applications of technology, Little KITEs nurtures a generation of innovators poised to shape the future. Recognising the transformative potential of AI, KITE introduced a groundbreaking AI training programme for 80,000 teachers in 2024. This three-day programme covered essential AI concepts, including summarisation techniques, data visualisation, prompt engineering and machine learning. Teachers also explored critical topics such as deepfakes, privacy concerns and algorithmic bias, fostering a culture of responsible AI usage. The training was widely praised for its practical content and its ability to reduce teachers’ workloads, equipping them with tools to integrate AI effectively into their teaching practices. AI in the Curriculum: A National First In a historic move, Kerala became the first Indian state to incorporate AI into its school curriculum in 2024. A dedicated chapter on AI was introduced in the ICT textbook for Class 7, featuring hands-on activities like Computer Vision, where students create AI programmes to recognise human facial expressions, identifying up to seven emotions. The curriculum also includes the PictoBlox package, akin to Scratch, which teaches visual programming and supports learning in AI, Robotics and other ICT skills. These activities not only foster technical proficiency but also promote life skills, cyber-safety and the ability to

identify fake news, ensuring a holistic educational experience. Samagra Plus AI: A Tailored AI Engine To address the limitations of existing AI solutions, which were not aligned with Kerala’s curriculum, KITE is developing Samagra Plus AI, a bespoke AI engine tailored to the state’s academic framework. Currently in the prototype testing phase, this platform supports teachers by providing curriculum-aligned digital resources, aiding lesson planning and enabling personalised learning in AI-enhanced classrooms. It also facilitates student assessments and individualised feedback, aligning with the principles of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE). Samagra Plus AI empowers teachers to create and customise digital learning materials, develop lesson plans and implement AI-integrated teaching strategies. By analysing student profiles and learning indicators, the platform identifies learning gaps and recommends targeted resources, ensuring personalised support for each student. Additionally, it enhances English language proficiency through interactive activities like puzzles, riddles and exercises in listening, speaking, reading and writing, making learning engaging and effective. A Global Model for Digital Education KITE’s integration of advanced technologies, including AI and robotics, with Free and Open- Source Software (FOSS) has created a dynamic and inclusive educational environment. By aligning cutting-edge tools with Kerala’s unique pedagogical needs, KITE has set a global benchmark for digital education. Its initiatives—from hi-tech classrooms and SAMAGRA to Little KITEs and Samagra Plus AI—demonstrate a commitment to fostering innovation, equity and excellence in education. As Kerala continues to lead the way in AIenabled education, KITE’s efforts underscore the transformative power of technology when harnessed with vision and

purpose. By empowering teachers, engaging students and building a robust digital ecosystem, KITE is not only shaping the future of education in Kerala but also inspiring the world.
