AI and technology in Manipur’s agriculture : A path to sustainable development Dr Laishram Kanta Singh, Dr Asem Ameeta Devi and Dr S Roma Devi 4. AI in Pest and Disease Management AI-powered drones and cameras can detect early signs of pest infestations or fungal infections, allowing farmers to take preventive measures. Example : “Trapview” uses AI-based pheromone traps to monitor and predict pest attacks. 5. Robotics and Automation : Small-scale AI-driven robots can assist in: Weeding and harvesting (e.g., “Agribot”); Autonomous tractors for hilly terrains. This reduces labor costs and increases efficiency. 6. AI for Post-Harvest Management Post-harvest losses in Manipur are significant due to poor storage. AI can help in: Predicting shelf life of perishable goods; Optimi- zing storage conditions using IoT-enabled warehouses Example: “Intello Labs” uses AI to grade and sort agricultural produce, reducing wastage. Farmers often sell produce at low prices due to lack of market access. AI-based platforms can: Predict demand and price trends Connect farmers directly to buyers via e-marketplaces Example: “eNAM” (National Agricultural Market) could be integrated with AI to help Manipuri farmers get better prices. Challenges in Implementing AI in Manipur’s Agriculture Despite its potential, AI adoption in Manipur faces hurdles: Limited Digital Infrastructure: Poor internet connectivity in rural areas restricts AI tool usage. High Initial Costs: Small farmers may not afford AI-based equipment. Lack of Awareness: Many farmers are unaware of AI’s benefits. Resistance to Change: Traditional farming practices are deeply rooted. Data Privacy Concerns: Farmers may hesitate to share farm

data with AI platforms. Government and Private Sector Initiatives “Digital Agriculture Mission” by the Indian government promotes AI in farming. “Manipur State Agriculture Policy” could integrate AI-based solutions. 2. Private and Startup Involvement Agri-tech startups can develop localized AI solutions for Manipur. Collaborations with universities (e.g., Central Agricultural University, Imphal) for AI research in agriculture. Training programs on AI tools for farmers. Pilot projects in districts like Thoubal and Imphal West. AI-Powered Vertical Farming: Given Manipur’s limited arable land, vertical farming with AI-controlled environments can boost production. Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency: AI + blockchain can track farm-to-market movement, ensuring fair pricing. AI in Organic Farming: Manipur’s organic produce (e.g., black rice) can gain global recognition with AI-driven certification and quality checks. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to transform Manipur’s agriculture by making it more productive, sustainable, and profitable. While challenges like infrastructure and awareness exist, coordinated efforts by the government, private sector, and farmers can accelerate AI adoption. By embracing AI-driven solutions, Manipur can ensure food security, reduce farmer distress, and position itself as a leader in smart agriculture in Northeast India.The future of Manipur’s farming lies in the synergy of traditional knowledge and cutting-edge AI technology, paving the way for a digitally empowered agrarian economy.
