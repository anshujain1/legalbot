7.5 lakh Punjab students to benefit from new English learning drive in 3,600 schools The Punjab government has launched The English Edge programme to improve English language skills among 7,50,000 students across 3,600 government schools over three years. The initiative combines AI-based learning with classroom instruction to enhance reading, writing, and communication proficiency. In a significant step to strengthen English proficiency and employability among school students, the Punjab government, in collaboration with education technology company EnglishHelper, has launched The English Edge, a large-scale English learning programme covering 3,600 government schools across 23 districts. The initiative aims to reach 7,50,000 students over the next three years, helping them develop strong communication skills aligned with the needs of higher education and global employment markets. THREE-PHASE ROLLOUT ACROSS PUNJAB The programme will be implemented in three phases, beginning with Phase I, which targets 500 schools and 300,000 students in Grades 9 to 12. It ensures inclusivity and equitable access for all learners, recognising English as a key to academic progress and career growth. EnglishHelper has worked with Punjab’s schools since 2013, beginning with a pilot project that was scaled up in 2015 in partnership with USAID. In March 2021, the Punjab Government signed an MoU with EnglishHelper to extend its reach to all secondary and senior secondary schools. Since then, nearly 150,000 technology-enabled classes have been conducted, strengthening reading and comprehension among students. AI-POWERED BLENDED LEARNING MODEL Speaking at the launch, EnglishHelper CEO Deepak Verma said, “We are excited to scale our proven

learning solutions across Punjab at an unprecedented level." He added, "This program addresses all four pillars of language acquisition, listening, speaking, reading, and writing, through a seamless combination of AI-powered self-learning and teacher-led instruction.” He further added that the goal is to equip students with not only linguistic skills but also the confidence to succeed globally. The programme integrates EnglishHelper’s Reading and Comprehension Assistant and ReadToMe classroom tool, combining self-learning with curriculum-aligned teaching. Built on learning science principles, The English Edge supports low-resource environments and aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's vision for foundational literacy, equity, and technology-driven education. The programme is funded through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) contributions and philanthropic support, demonstrating a public–private partnership model in education. Chief Minister Manik Saha described the initiative as a major step in bridging the digital and language learning gap in Punjab. The state’s collaboration with EnglishHelper reflects how government–industry partnerships can drive educational equity and innovation.
