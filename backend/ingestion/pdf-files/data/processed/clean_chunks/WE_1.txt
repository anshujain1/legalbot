The new cell, based at Bhabani Bhawan, Alipore, will act as the nodal unit responsible for the introduction, integration, and overall governance of AI across the organisation, according to an October 29 order by Director General of Police (DGP) Rajeev Kumar. Bhabani Bhawan is the state police’s operational hub. “The establishment of this AI Cell reflects the West Bengal Police’s proactive approach to addressing contemporary challenges such as cybercrime, digital evidence management, and the need for greater accountability,” a police official said. “While the police force has already utilised AI tools in areas like prison surveillance, this institutionalised governance unit signals a strategic shift from traditional methods to data-led, technology-enabled enforcement,” the official added. The success of the initiative will depend on how quickly pilot projects translate into tangible frontline impact and how effectively the force can be trained and change-managed to adopt the new technology while mitigating risks like data misuse and surveillance concerns, the official pointed out. The cell’s mandate

includes formulating and periodically updating the official AI Strategy and Implementation Framework for the organisation, with special emphasis on recommending policies for the ethical, transparent, and accountable use of AI across police functions. It will also be tasked with identifying specific processes where AI-based solutions can improve accuracy and decision-making, and will facilitate the design, development, and deployment of pilot AI projects in coordination with various police branches. “The AI Cell will also be responsible for developing and implementing rigorous data management and security guidelines for all AI initiatives to ensure compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity standards, signalling a robust commitment to modernising law enforcement while maintaining public trust and adherence to legal mandates,” read the order. Critical to its function is the responsibility for capacity building, including conducting training and workshops to boost the AI literacy of officers and staff, alongside establishing crucial linkages with academic institutions, industry partners, startups, and government agencies to foster knowledge exchange. As per sources, the cell may take additional experts’ help and resource persons for furthering its objectives. The Al Cell will function under the administrative control of DGP Kumar. It will meet at least once every two weeks, or as required, to review progress and approve new initiatives. A consolidated report on Al-related activities will be submitted to the competent authority every six months, officials said.
