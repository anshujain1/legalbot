Pushkar Singh Dhami on Tuesday launched several information and communications technology (ICT)-enabled services. These included the Digital Uttarakhand app, 66 websites built on the Secure, Scalable, and Sugamya (S3Waas) platform, a GIS-based web application for real-time tracking of garbage collection vehicles in urban areas, AI innovation in the 1905 CM Helpline for enhanced citizen service, and a web-based application for encroachment monitoring. CM's announcements- A next-generation Data Centre will be established in Uttarakhand to meet future challenges, with a dedicated disaster recovery mechanism. - An “AI Mission” will soon be launched in the state to address future challenges, which will be developed as a “Centre of Excellence.” - Taking forward the concept of Good Governance, a next-generation Remote Sensing and Drone Application Centre will be developed in the state. - The government will work towards establishing a dedicated IT cadre in the state. CM Dhami said that Uttarakhand, along with being a beautiful hill state, should also move forward as a technologically advanced state. For this, the state government is working on the mantra of “Hill to Hi-Tech.” “Today, five significant IT initiatives have been launched in the state. These innovations will not only improve governance but also bring speed and transparency to various services. He added that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, technology and innovation have expanded through the Digital India campaign. The state government is also making continuous efforts to realise the Prime Minister’s vision of Digital India. Through the Digital Uttarakhand app, people will be able

to avail multiple government services from home, eliminating the need to visit government offices. This app will help realise the prime minister’s mantra of Minimum Government – Maximum Governance by making government services more integrated, simple, and accessible, as well as enabling easy monitoring of various activities,” he stated. The CM added that the 66 new government websites based on the S3Waas platform will deliver departmental information to the public securely, promptly, and transparently. The GIS-based web app will provide real-time monitoring of garbage collection vehicles in urban areas. For preventing encroachment, citizens will be able to upload photos or videos of encroachments through a web-based app, on which the concerned department will promptly investigate and take necessary action. The entire process will be trackable online. He further said that the 1905 CM Helpline is an important medium of communication between citizens and the government. AI-based features in this service will allow for auto-categorisation of complaints, faster resolution, and improved follow-up monitoring. The chief minister highlighted that special priority is being given to initiatives like online education, e-health services, and digitisation of land records. Through the e-District portal and CM Dashboard, efforts are being made to provide multiple government services to citizens from the comfort of their homes. Smart classrooms and e-learning platforms are being expanded for students, while telemedicine and e-Sanjeevani services are bringing specialist doctors’ advice to citizens in remote areas. The Apni Sarkar portal is providing 886 services online, and nearly 95% of villages in the state

now have telecommunication connectivity.
