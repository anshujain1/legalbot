Agartala: Tripura chief minister Manik Saha unveiled the state disaster management plan on Tuesday, emphasising the need to harness technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce the loss of life and property during disasters. Launching a series of initiatives under the revenue department, the CM said, "In today's tech-driven world, we must prioritise the integration of advanced technologies and AI in disaster preparedness and response. Alongside this, creating public awareness and enhancing the skills of workers and volunteers involved in rescue operations is absolutely crucial." As part of the unveiling, the CM inaugurated several new projects, including a Technology Demonstration Unit at Hapania, the civil defence training scheme, 26 automated weather stations and rain gauges across the state, a disaster management equipment verification portal, and a change of land use (diversion of land) portal. Developed at a cost of Rs 50 lakh, these initiatives aim to revolutionise disaster preparedness and strengthen governance. Highlighting the state's vulnerability, Saha recalled the devastation caused by Cyclone Sitrang (2022), Cyclone Mocha (2023), Cyclone Remal (2024), and the major floods of 2018 and 2024, he added. "Thousands of volunteers will be trained at the technology demonstration unit. Under the civil defence training scheme, 2,880 volunteers will receive specialized training to strengthen first-response capabilities during emergencies," he added. The CM further emphasised the importance of accurate and real-time weather data in disaster mitigation. He announced plans for a Doppler Weather Radar Station in Belonia, while 26 automated weather monitoring stations and rain gauges have already been

installed across Tripura. To streamline operations, the CM also launched the disaster management equipment verification portal, which will help track equipment availability across districts, subdivisions, and TSR battalions.
