Revolutionizing e-governance in Arunachal: Launch of Digital Projects under the Year of e-Governance 2022-23 Arunachal Pradesh saw the introduction of several ground-breaking projects during the Year of e-Governance 2022–23, marking a significant step towards a digitally empowered society. These initiatives, led by Arunachal Pradesh’s Honourable Chief Minister, Shri Pema Khandu, will transform how citizens interact with the government and streamline service delivery. Let’s take a look at some of the significant projects that will influence the future of government in Arunachal Pradesh, focusing on the most recent implementations. CM e-Jansunwai: Efficient Grievance Redressal at Your Fingertips One of the highlights of the year of e-Governance is the introduction of CM e-Jansunwai, an integrated online citizen grievance redressal portal. This user-friendly website, developed by the Department of IT&C’s internal team, promises to deliver fast and effective solutions to citizens’ issues. Citizens can easily file, track, and avail solutions to their grievances using a well-organized graphical user interface (GUI) within a 30-day time frame. If customers are dissatisfied, they may forward their concerns to the appellate authority, ensuring a fair and transparent redressal process. CM Arunachal e-Seva: Unifying Government Services CM Arunachal e-Seva acts as a single online platform for all government e-services, providing citizens with ease and efficiency. This portal facilitates access to over 86 services by merging diverse government-to-citizen (G2C), government-to-business (G2B), and government-to-government (G2G) services. Citizens can now effortlessly access government services using e-Seva, with a single login, contributing to the state’s ease of living and convenience of doing

business. CM Dashboard 2.0: Empowering Central and State Government Monitoring CM Dashboard 2.0 is a centralised web-based dashboard that monitors initiatives conducted by both the central and state governments to improve accountability and transparency. This portal provides a complete insight into the project’s progress by combining and showing real-time data from different e-governance projects. It assists in finding areas for improvement, assessing the efficacy of departmental services, and making data-driven policy decisions. e-Pragati Portal and CSS Saturation Tracker: Cultivating Proactive Governance The government of Arunachal Pradesh launched the e-Pragati Portal and CSS Saturation Tracker to ensure effective programme and project monitoring. These multipurpose platforms include data management, tracking, and monitoring tools, allowing proactive governance and facilitating streamlined stakeholder participation. The state intends to use these tools to meet the targets set for centrally funded and central sector schemes, supporting sustainable development and efficient resource allocation. MIS Project: Digitizing Healthcare Infrastructure The Arunachal Pradesh government has launched the integrated Hospital Management Information System (iHMIS) in a bid to highlight the importance of digital infrastructure in the healthcare sector. This flagship project of the Government of India, aligned with the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, seeks to fill gaps amongst stakeholders in the field of health care. With the MIS portal fully operational, hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the state can manage patient data, billing, emergency services, and telemedicine more efficiently, resulting in improved healthcare access and delivery. In general, the official launch of these digital projects under the Year of e-Governance

2022–23 is a major step towards strengthening service delivery to citizens in Arunachal Pradesh. The integration of services under a single platform, a focused mechanism for citizen-centered grievance redressal, and the centralized monitoring of government initiatives will certainly encourage transparency and accountability among Govt stakeholders and officials. These projects are also anticipated to foster a conducive environment to enhance ease of living and ease of doing business for the citizens of Arunachal Pradesh.
